	---help---
	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.  At this writing, the primary
	  implementation of EHCI is a chip from NEC, widely available in add-on
	  PCI cards, but implementations are in the works from other vendors
	  including Intel and Philips.  Motherboard support is appearing.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if it the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ehci-hcd.

config USB_EHCI_SPLIT_ISO
	bool "Full speed ISO transactions (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	---help---
	  This code is new and hasn't been used with many different
	  EHCI or USB 2.0 transaction translator implementations.
	  It should work for ISO-OUT transfers, like audio.

config USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT
	bool "Root Hub Transaction Translators (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  This supports the EHCI implementation from TransDimension Inc.

	---help---
	  The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing
	  USB 1.1 host controller hardware.  It does more in hardware than Intel's
	  UHCI specification.  If your USB host controller follows the OHCI spec,
	  say Y.  On most non-x86 systems, and on x86 hardware that's not using a
	  USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host
	  controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI
	  based system where you're not sure, the "lspci -v" entry will list the
	  right "prog-if" for your USB controller(s):  EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ohci-hcd.

	  The Universal Host Controller Interface is a standard by Intel for
	  accessing the USB hardware in the PC (which is also called the USB
	  host controller). If your USB host controller conforms to this
	  standard, you may want to say Y, but see below. All recent boards
	  with Intel PCI chipsets (like intel 430TX, 440FX, 440LX, 440BX,
	  i810, i820) conform to this standard. Also all VIA PCI chipsets
	  (like VIA VP2, VP3, MVP3, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro II or Apollo Pro
	  133). If unsure, say Y.

	  The SL811HS is a single-port USB controller that supports either
	  host side or peripheral side roles.  Enable this option if your

	  REX-CFU1U CF card (often used with PDAs).  If unsure, say N.
