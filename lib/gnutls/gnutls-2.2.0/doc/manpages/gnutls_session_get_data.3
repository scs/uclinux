.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns all session parameters, in order to support resuming.
The client should call this, and keep the returned session, if he wants to
resume that current version later by calling \fBgnutls_session_set_data()\fP

Resuming sessions is really useful and speedups connections after a succesful one.
