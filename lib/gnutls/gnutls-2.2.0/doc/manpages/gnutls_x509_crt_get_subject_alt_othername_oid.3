.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid \- Get SAN otherName OID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", unsigned int " seq ", void * " ret ", size_t * " ret_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t structure
.IP "unsigned int seq" 12
specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)
.IP "void * ret" 12
is the place where the otherName OID will be copied to
.IP "size_t * ret_size" 12
holds the size of ret.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the type OID of an otherName Subject
Alternative Name, contained in the given certificate, and return
the type as an enumerated element.

This function is only useful if
\fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()\fP returned
\fBGNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME\fP.

Returns the alternative subject name type on success.  The type is
one of the enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  For
supported OIDs, it will return one of the virtual
(GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_*) types, e.g. \fBGNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP\fP,
and \fBGNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME\fP for unknown OIDs.  It will return
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if \fIret_size\fP is not large enough to
hold the value.  In that case \fIret_size\fP will be updated with the
required size.  If the certificate does not have an Alternative
name with the specified sequence number and with the otherName type
then \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP is returned.
