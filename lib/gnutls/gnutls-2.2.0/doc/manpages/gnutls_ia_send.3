.SH NAME
gnutls_ia_send \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/extra.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_ia_send(gnutls_session_t " session ", const char * " data ", size_t " sizeofdata ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * data" 12
contains the data to send
.IP "size_t sizeofdata" 12
is the length of the data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Send TLS/IA application payload data.  This function has the
similar semantics with \fBsend()\fP. The only difference is that is
accepts a GNUTLS session, and uses different error codes.

The TLS/IA protocol is synchronous, so you cannot send more than
one packet at a time.  The client always send the first packet.

To finish an application phase in the server, use
\fBgnutls_ia_endphase_send()\fP.  The client cannot end an application
phase unilaterally; rather, a client is required to respond with an
endphase of its own if gnutls_ia_recv indicates that the server has
sent one.

If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function (the default
is \fBsend()\fP} then \fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP will be returned.  If
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP or \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP is returned, you must call
this function again, with the same parameters; alternatively you
could provide a \fBNULL\fP pointer for data, and 0 for size.

Returns the number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.
