.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_openpgp_crt_t key" 12
is an OpenPGP key
.IP "unsigned int * bits" 12
if bits is non null it will hold the size of the parameters' in bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the public key algorithm of an OpenPGP
certificate.

If bits is non null, it should have enough size to hold the parameters
size in bits. For RSA the bits returned is the modulus. 
For DSA the bits returned are of the public exponent.

Returns a member of the GNUTLS_PKAlgorithm enumeration on success,
or a negative value on error.
