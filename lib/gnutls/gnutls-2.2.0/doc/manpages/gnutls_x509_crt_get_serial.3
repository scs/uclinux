.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the X.509 certificate's serial number. 
This is obtained by the X509 Certificate serialNumber
field. Serial is not always a 32 or 64bit number. Some CAs use
large serial numbers, thus it may be wise to handle it as something
opaque. 

Returns 0 on success and a negative value in case of an error.
