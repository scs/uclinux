.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate subject, specified
by the given OID. The input string should be ASCII or UTF\-8 encoded.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
With this function you can only set the known OIDs. You can test
for known OIDs using \fBgnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()\fP. For OIDs that are
not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and
call this function with raw_flag set.

Returns 0 on success.
