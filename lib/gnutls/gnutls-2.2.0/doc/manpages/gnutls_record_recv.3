.SH NAME
gnutls_record_recv \- reads data from the TLS record protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_recv(gnutls_session_t " session ", void * " data ", size_t " sizeofdata ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "void * data" 12
the buffer that the data will be read into
.IP "size_t sizeofdata" 12
the number of requested bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function has the similar semantics with \fBrecv()\fP. The only
difference is that is accepts a GNUTLS session, and uses different
error codes.

In the special case that a server requests a renegotiation, the
client may receive an error code of \fBGNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE\fP.  This
message may be simply ignored, replied with an alert containing
NO_RENEGOTIATION, or replied with a new handshake, depending on
the client's will.

If \fBEINTR\fP is returned by the internal push function (the default
is \fBrecv()\fP) then \fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP will be returned.  If
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP or \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP is returned, you must
call this function again to get the data.  See also
\fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP.

A server may also receive \fBGNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE\fP when a client has
initiated a handshake. In that case the server can only initiate a
handshake or terminate the connection.
.SH "RETURNS"
the number of bytes received and zero on EOF.  A negative
error code is returned in case of an error.  The number of bytes
received might be less than \fIsizeofdata\fP.
