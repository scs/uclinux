.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns all session parameters, in order to support resuming.
The client should call this, and keep the returned session, if he wants to
resume that current version later by calling \fBgnutls_session_set_data()\fP
This function must be called after a successful handshake. The returned
datum must be freed with \fBgnutls_free()\fP.

Resuming sessions is really useful and speedups connections after a succesful one.
