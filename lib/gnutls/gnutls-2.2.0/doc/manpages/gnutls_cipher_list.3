.SH NAME
gnutls_cipher_list \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "const gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t * gnutls_cipher_list( " void ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Get a list of supported cipher algorithms.  Note that not
necessarily all ciphers are supported as TLS cipher suites.  For
example, DES is not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported
for other purposes (e.g., PKCS\fB8\fP or similar).
.SH "RETURNS"
a zero\-terminated list of \fBgnutls_cipher_algorithm_t\fP
integers indicating the available ciphers.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
