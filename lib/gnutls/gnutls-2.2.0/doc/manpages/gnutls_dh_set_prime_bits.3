.SH NAME
gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits \- Used to set the bits for a DH ciphersuite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "unsigned int bits" 12
is the number of bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the number of bits, for use in an 
Diffie Hellman key exchange. This is used both in DH ephemeral and
DH anonymous cipher suites. This will set the
minimum size of the prime that will be used for the handshake.

In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.
If a server sends a prime with less bits than that 
GNUTLS_E_DH_PRIME_UNACCEPTABLE will be returned by the
handshake.
