.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known \- This function will return true if the given OID is known
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known(const char * " oid ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const char * oid" 12
holds an Object Identifier in a null terminated string
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will inform about known DN OIDs. This is useful since functions
like \fBgnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()\fP use the information on known
OIDs to properly encode their input. Object Identifiers that are not
known are not encoded by these functions, and their input is stored directly
into the ASN.1 structure. In that case of unknown OIDs, you have
the responsibility of DER encoding your data.

Returns 1 on known OIDs and 0 otherwise.
