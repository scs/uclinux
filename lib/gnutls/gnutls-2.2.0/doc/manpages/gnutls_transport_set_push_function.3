.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the function where you set a push function for gnutls
to use in order to send data. If you are going to use berkeley style
sockets, you do not need to use this function since
the default (send(2)) will probably be ok. Otherwise you should
specify this function for gnutls to be able to send data.

PUSH_FUNC is of the form, 
ssize_t (*gnutls_push_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const void*, size_t);
