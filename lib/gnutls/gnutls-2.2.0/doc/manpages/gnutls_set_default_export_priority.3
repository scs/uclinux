.SH NAME
gnutls_set_default_export_priority \- Sets some default priority on the cipher suites supported by gnutls.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_set_default_export_priority(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets some default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs
and compression methods.  This function also includes weak algorithms.
.SH "THIS IS THE SAME AS CALLING"

gnutls_priority_set_direct (session, "EXPORT", NULL);

This function is kept around for backwards compatibility, but
because of its wide use it is still fully supported.  If you wish
to allow users to provide a string that specify which ciphers to
use (which is recommended), you should use
\fBgnutls_priority_set_direct()\fP or \fBgnutls_priority_set()\fP instead.

Returns 0 on success.
