.SH NAME
gnutls_priority_init \- Sets priorities for the cipher suites supported by gnutls.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t * " priority_cache ", const char * " priorities ", const char ** " err_pos ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache" 12
is a \fBgnutls_prioritity_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * priorities" 12
is a string describing priorities
.IP "const char ** err_pos" 12
In case of an error this will have the position in the string the error occured
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets priorities for the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs and
compression methods. This is to avoid using the
gnutls_*\fB_priority()\fP functions.

The \fBpriorities\fP option allows you to specify a semi\-colon
separated list of the cipher priorities to enable.

Unless the first keyword is "NONE" the defaults are:
.SH "PROTOCOLS"
TLS1.1, TLS1.0, and SSL3.0.
.SH "COMPRESSION"
NULL.
.SH "CERTIFICATE TYPES"
X.509, OpenPGP.
.SH "YOU CAN ALSO USE PREDEFINED SETS OF CIPHERSUITES"
"PERFORMANCE"
all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled, limited to 128 bit
ciphers and sorted by terms of speed performance.

"NORMAL" option enables all "secure" ciphersuites. The 256\-bit ciphers
are included as a fallback only. The ciphers are sorted by security margin.

"SECURE128" flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites with ciphers up to 
128 bits, sorted by security margin.

"SECURE256" flag enables all "secure" ciphersuites including the 256 bit
ciphers, sorted by security margin.

"EXPORT" all the ciphersuites are enabled, including the
low\-security 40 bit ciphers.

"NONE" nothing is enabled. This disables even protocols and
compression methods.
.SH "SPECIAL KEYWORDS"
'!' or '\-' appended with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.
'+' appended with an algorithm will add this algorithm.
'\fBCOMPAT\fP' will enable compatibility features for a server.

To avoid collisions in order to specify a compression algorithm in
this string you have to prefix it with "COMP\-", protocol versions
with "VERS\-" and certificate types with "CTYPE\-". All other
algorithms don't need a prefix.

For key exchange algorithms when in NORMAL or SECURE levels the
perfect forward secrecy algorithms take precendence of the other
protocols.  In all cases all the supported key exchange algorithms
are enabled (except for the RSA\-EXPORT which is only enabled in
EXPORT level).

Note that although one can select very long key sizes (such as 256 bits) 
for symmetric algorithms, to actually increase security the public key
algorithms have to use longer key sizes as well.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
"NORMAL:!AES\-128\-CBC",
"EXPORT:!VERS\-TLS1.0:+COMP\-DEFLATE:+CTYPE\-OPENPGP",
"NONE:+VERS\-TLS1.0:+AES\-128\-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP\-NULL", "NORMAL",
"NORMAL:\fBCOMPAT\fP".
.SH "RETURNS"
On syntax error GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is returned and
0 on success.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
