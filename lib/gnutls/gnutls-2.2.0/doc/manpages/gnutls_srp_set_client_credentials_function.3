.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t          cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_srp_server_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function          * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username and
password for client SRP authentication.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username,
char** password);

The \fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP must be allocated using \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP.
\fIusername\fP and \fIpassword\fP should be ASCII strings or UTF\-8 strings 
prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of "stringprep".

The callback function will be called once per handshake before the
initial hello message is sent.

The callback should not return a negative error code the second
time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

The callback function should return 0 on success.
\-1 indicates an error.
