.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function(gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t          " cred ", gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function          * " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t          cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_psk_server_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function          * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's PSK credentials.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
gnutls_datum_t* key);

\fIusername\fP contains the actual username. 
The \fIkey\fP must be filled in using the \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP. 

In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
assume that the username does not exist.

The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
callback function should return 0 on success, while \-1 indicates
an error.
