.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS

is a gnutls session
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will try to verify the peer's certificate and return
its status (trusted, invalid etc.).  However you must also check
the peer's name in order to check if the verified certificate
belongs to the actual peer.

The return value should be one or more of the
gnutls_certificate_status_t enumerated elements bitwise or'd, or a
negative value on error.

This is the same as \fBgnutls_x509_crt_list_verify()\fP.
.SH "DEPRECATED"
Use \fBgnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()\fP instead.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
