.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const char * " oid ", int " indx ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12

a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
initially holds the size of \fIbuf\fP
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non zero if the extension is marked as critical
