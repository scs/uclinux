.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_data \- This function will sign the given data using the private key params
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_privkey_sign_data(gnutls_x509_privkey_t " key ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " digest ", unsigned int " flags ", const gnutls_datum_t * " data ", void * " signature ", size_t * " signature_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t key" 12
Holds the key
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t digest" 12
should be MD5 or SHA1
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be 0 for now
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
holds the data to be signed
.IP "void * signature" 12
will contain the signature
.IP "size_t * signature_size" 12
holds the size of signature (and will be replaced
by the new size)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the given data using a signature algorithm
supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are always used
together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions may be
used for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA\-1 for the DSA keys.

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
*signature_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
be returned.

In case of failure a negative value will be returned, and
0 on success.
