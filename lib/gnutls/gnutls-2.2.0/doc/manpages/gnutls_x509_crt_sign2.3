.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_sign2 \- This function will sign a certificate with a key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_sign2(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", gnutls_x509_crt_t " issuer ", gnutls_x509_privkey_t " issuer_key ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " dig ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crt_t structure
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t issuer" 12
is the certificate of the certificate issuer
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t issuer_key" 12
holds the issuer's private key
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig" 12
The message digest to use. GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1 is the safe choice unless you know what you're doing.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private key, and

This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all
the previously set parameters are now signed.
