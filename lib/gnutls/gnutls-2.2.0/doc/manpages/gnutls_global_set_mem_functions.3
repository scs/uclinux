.SH NAME
gnutls_global_set_mem_functions \- This function sets the memory allocation functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_global_set_mem_functions(gnutls_alloc_function " alloc_func ", gnutls_alloc_function      " secure_alloc_func ", gnutls_is_secure_function      " is_secure_func ", gnutls_realloc_function " realloc_func ", gnutls_free_function " free_func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_alloc_function alloc_func" 12
it's the default memory allocation function. Like \fBmalloc()\fP.
.IP "gnutls_alloc_function      secure_alloc_func" 12
This is the memory allocation function that will be used for sensitive data.
.IP "gnutls_is_secure_function      is_secure_func" 12
a function that returns 0 if the memory given is not secure. May be NULL.
.IP "gnutls_realloc_function realloc_func" 12
A realloc function
.IP "gnutls_free_function free_func" 12
The function that frees allocated data. Must accept a NULL pointer.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the function were you set the memory allocation functions gnutls
is going to use. By default the libc's allocation functions (\fBmalloc()\fP, \fBfree()\fP),
are used by gnutls, to allocate both sensitive and not sensitive data.
This function is provided to set the memory allocation functions to
something other than the defaults (ie the gcrypt allocation functions). 

This function must be called before \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP is called.
