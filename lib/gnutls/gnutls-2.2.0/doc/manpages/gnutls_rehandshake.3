.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_rehandshake(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will renegotiate security parameters with the
client.  This should only be called in case of a server.

This message informs the peer that we want to renegotiate
parameters (perform a handshake).

If this function succeeds (returns 0), you must call the
\fBgnutls_handshake()\fP function in order to negotiate the new
parameters.

If the client does not wish to renegotiate parameters he will
should with an alert message, thus the return code will be
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED\fP and the alert will be
\fBGNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION\fP.  A client may also choose to ignore
this message.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.
