.SH NAME
gnutls_transport_set_errno \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_transport_set_errno(gnutls_session_t " session ", int " err ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "int err" 12
error value to store in session-specific errno variable.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Store \fIerr\fP in the session\-specific errno variable.  Useful values
for \fIerr\fP is EAGAIN and EINTR, other values are treated will be
treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

This function is useful in replacement push/pull functions set by
gnutls_transport_set_push_function and
gnutls_transport_set_pullpush_function under Windows, where the
replacement push/pull may not have access to the same \fIerrno\fP
variable that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to
msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

If you don't have the \fIsession\fP variable easily accessible from the
push/pull function, and don't worry about thread conflicts, you can
also use \fBgnutls_transport_set_global_errno()\fP.
