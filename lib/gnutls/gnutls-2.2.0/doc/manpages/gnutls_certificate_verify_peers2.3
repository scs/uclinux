.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 \- This function returns the peer's certificate verification status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int * " status ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a gnutls session
.IP "unsigned int * status" 12
is the output of the verification
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will try to verify the peer's certificate and return
its status (trusted, invalid etc.).  The value of \fIstatus\fP should
be one or more of the gnutls_certificate_status_t enumerated
elements bitwise or'd. To avoid denial of service attacks some
default upper limits regarding the certificate key size and chain
size are set. To override them use
\fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits()\fP.

Note that you must also check the peer's name in order to check if
the verified certificate belongs to the actual peer.

This is the same as \fBgnutls_x509_crt_list_verify()\fP and uses the
loaded CAs in the credentials as trusted CAs.

Note that some commonly used X.509 Certificate Authorities are
still using Version 1 certificates.  If you want to accept them,
you need to call \fBgnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags()\fP with, e.g.,
\fBGNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT\fP parameter.
.SH "RETURNS"
a negative error code on error and zero on success.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
