.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id \- Return unique ID of public key's parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", unsigned int " flags ", unsigned char * " output_data ", size_t * " output_data_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t crt" 12
Holds the certificate
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be 0 for now
.IP "unsigned char * output_data" 12
will contain the key ID
.IP "size_t * output_data_size" 12
holds the size of output_data (and will be
replaced by the actual size of parameters)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return a unique ID the depends on the public
key parameters. This ID can be used in checking whether a
certificate corresponds to the given private key.

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
*output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
be returned.  The output will normally be a SHA\-1 hash output,
which is 20 bytes.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
In case of failure a negative value will be
returned, and 0 on success.
