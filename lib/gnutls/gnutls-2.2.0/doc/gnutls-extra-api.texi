@deftypefun {const char *} {gnutls_extra_check_version} (const char * @var{req_version})
@var{req_version}: the version to check

Check that the version of the gnutls-extra library is at minimum
the requested one and return the version string; return NULL if the
condition is not satisfied.  If a NULL is passed to this function,
no check is done, but the version string is simply returned.

@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_global_init_extra} ( @var{void})

This function initializes the global state of gnutls-extra library
to defaults.  Returns zero on success.

Note that @code{gnutls_global_init()} has to be called before this
function.  If this function is not called then the gnutls-extra
library will not be usable.
