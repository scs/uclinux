GNU SASL LIBRARY README-alpha -- Important notes for alpha releases.
Copyright (C) 2003, 2004, 2007 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

GNU SASL Library is unstable.  You should expect it to not work.  You
should expect it to have security problems.  The API will likely
change.  This is the development release.  A proper release will be
made in due time.  Let me repeat that, GNU SASL LIBRARY IS MOST LIKELY
INSECURE. DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!

The code will go through a security review before the stable release
is made.  Volunteers needed.

It will not become stable without help.  Donate time or money.

To compile from version controlled sources rather than a
libgsasl-*.tar.gz archive, you need autoconf (2.61), automake (1.10),
libtool (1.5.2), and gettext (0.16.1).  Bootstrap the build
environment with:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Then run ./configure etc as usual.
