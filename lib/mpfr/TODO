##############################################################################

Documentation:

- add a description of the algorithms used + proof of correctness

- mpfr_set_prec: add an explanation of how to speed up calculations
  which increase their precision at each step.

- solve the problem with @pxref{Custom Allocation,,, gmp,GNU MP}
	[gives broken link on the html version]

Installation:

- from Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>:
  Determine the exp2/exp3 thresholds using tune/tuneup.c.
  A start has been made on this, but there's a noticable step-effect
  in the times making them cross back and forward between which is
  faster.  Hopefully this will go away with improvements to the exp
  code.

- Build a dynamic library (.so / .dll).

- Maybe use the autotools to manage properly the version number,
  ie create mpfr.texi.in, mpfr.h.in, version.c.in, VERSION.in
  and substitute MPFR_MAJOR_VERSION, MPFR_MINOR_VERSION,
  MPFR_PATCHLEVEL_VERSION within configure?

Changes in existing functions:

- merge mpfr_inp_str, mpfr_set_str to use mpfr_strtofr
- mpfr_get_str should support base up to 62 too.

- mpfr_can_round:
1) remove the first rounding mode (rnd1) that was giving the direction of
   the error. We'll consider now that the sign of the error is unknown.
   This will simplify the code, should not loose too much since in most
   cases we call mpfr_can_round with rnd1 = nearest, and should detect cases
   with exact results that may loop.
2) change the meaning of the 2nd argument (err). Currently the error is
   at most 2^(MPFR_EXP(b)-err), i.e. err is the relative shift wrt the
   most significant bit of the approximation. I propose that the error
   is now at most 2^err ulps of the approximation, i.e.
   2^(MPFR_EXP(b)-MPFR_PREC(b)+err).
3) the current code performs two computations to check if we can round:
   it checks if both round(approx-error) and round(approx+error) give
   the same result. One computation is enough: for example in directed
   rounding, if the round bit is 0 (resp. 1), we just have to check
   round(approx-error) (resp. round(approx+error)).

New functions to implement:

- modf (to extract integer and fractional parts), suggested by
	Dmitry Antipov <dmitry.antipov@mail.ru> Thu, 13 Jun 2002
- those from LIA: missing secant, cosecant, cotangent (trigo/hyperbolic)
- atan2
- mpfr_root to compute x^(1/n) for n integer, similar to mpz_root
	[suggested by Damien Fisher, damien@maths.usyd.edu.au, 20 Jul 2003,
	and Mark Watkins <watkins@maths.usyd.edu.au>, 23 Jul 2003]
- mpfr_fmod (mpfr_t, mpfr_srcptr, mpfr_srcptr, mp_rnd_t)
  [suggested by Tomas Zahradnicky <tomas@24uSoftware.com>, 29 Nov 2003]
  Kevin: Might want to be called mpfr_mod, to match mpz_mod.
  -> we probably want to allow both mpfr_fmod and mpfr_mod.
- mpfr_fms for a-b*c
  [suggested by Tomas Zahradnicky <tomas@24uSoftware.com>, 29 Nov 2003]
- 1/sqrt(x) [Regis Dupont <dupont@lix.polytechnique.fr>, 15 Sep 2004]
- dilog() [the dilogarithm: dilog(x) =  int(ln(t)/(1-t), t=1..x)]

Efficiency:

- implement range reduction in sin/cos/tan for large arguments
	(currently too slow for 2^1024)
- mpfr_asin/acos are too slow for small values (2^(-1021) for example)
- idem for mpfr_atanh (2^(-1021) for example)
- improve generic.c to work for number of terms <> 2^k
- rewrite mpfr_greater_p... as native code.
- mpfr_mul(a,b,c): truncate b,c when their precision is larger than that of a
- mpfr_tanh is inefficient is x is large (Pb of overflow too).
  Should compute tanh(x)-1=-2/(exp(2x)+1) instead?

- mpf_t uses a scheme where the number of limbs actually present can
  be less than the selected precision, thereby allowing low precision
  values (for instance small integers) to be stored and manipulated in
  an mpf_t efficiently.

  Perhaps mpfr should get something similar, especially if looking to
  replace mpf with mpfr, though it'd be a major change.  Alternately
  perhaps those mpfr routines like mpfr_mul where optimizations are
  possible through stripping low zero bits or limbs could check for
  that (this would be less efficient but easier).

Miscellaneous:

- rename mpf2mpfr.h to gmp-mpf2mpfr.h?
  (will wait until mpfr is fully integrated into gmp :-)

- from Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>:
   Also for pi.c, a pre-calculated compiled-in pi to a few thousand
   digits would be good value I think.  After all, say 10000 bits using
   1250 bytes would still be small compared to the code size!
   Store pi in round to zero mode (to recover other modes).

- add a new rounding mode: rounding away from 0. This can be easily
  implemented as follows: round to zero, and if the result is inexact,
	add one ulp to the mantissa.
- add a new rounding mode: round to nearest, with ties away from zero
  (will be in 754r, could be used by mpfr_round)
- add a new roundind mode: round to odd. If the result is not exactly
	representable, then round to the odd mantissa. This rounding
	has the nice property that for k > 1, if:
	y = round(x, p+k, TO_ODD)
        z = round(y, p, TO_NEAREST_EVEN), then
        z = round(x, p, TO_NEAREST_EVEN)
  so it avoids the double-rounding problem.

- check/define the sign of infinity for gamma(-integer)

- add tests of the ternary value for constants

Reentrancy / Thread-Safety:

- Temporary changes to emin/emax are not safe (all uses of
  mpfr_save_emin_emax, eg. mpfr_set_q).

- Global variables for caching in mpfr_const_log2 and mpfr_const_pi
  are not safe.


Portability:

- [Kevin about texp.c long strings]
  For strings longer than c99 guarantees, it might be cleaner to
  introduce a "tests_strdupcat" or something to concatenate literal
  strings into newly allocated memory.  I thought I'd done that in a
  couple of places already.  Arrays of chars are not much fun.

Possible future MPF / MPFR integration:

- mpf routines can become "extern inline"s calling mpfr equivalents,
  probably just with GMP_RNDZ hard coded, since that's what mpf has
  always done.

- Want to preserve the mpf_t structure size, for binary compatibility.
  Breaking compatibility would cause lots of pain and potential subtle
  breakage for users.  If the fields in mpf_t are not enough then
  extra space under _mp_d can be used.

- mpf_sgn has been a macro directly accessing the _mp_size field, so a
  compatible representation would be required.  At worst that field
  could be maintained for mpf_sgn, but not otherwise used internally.

  mpf_sgn should probably throw an exception if called with NaN, since
  there's no useful value it can return, so it might want to become a
  function.  Inlined copies in existing binaries would hopefully never
  see a NaN, if they only do old-style mpf things.

- mpfr routines replacing mpf routines must be reentrant and thread
  safe, since of course that's what has been documented for mpf.

- mpfr_random will not be wanted since there's no corresponding
  mpf_random and new routines should not use the old style global
  random state.
