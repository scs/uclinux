1 Introduction to MPFR
**********************

MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision
arithmetic on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library.
It aims to extend the class of floating-point numbers provided by the
GNU MP library by a precise semantics. The main differences with the
`mpf' class from GNU MP are:

   * the `mpfr' code is portable, i.e. the result of any operation does
     not depend (or should not) on the machine word size
     `mp_bits_per_limb' (32 or 64 on most machines);

   * the precision in bits can be set exactly to any valid value for
     each variable (including very small precision);

   * `mpfr' provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE 754-1985
     standard.

   In particular, with a precision of 53 bits, `mpfr' should be able to
exactly reproduce all computations with double-precision machine
floating-point numbers (`double' type in C), except the default
exponent range is much wider and subnormal numbers are not implemented.

   This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License.  It is permitted to link MPFR to non-free programs, as long as
when distributing them the MPFR source code and a means to re-link with
a modified MPFR library is provided.

1.1 How to use this Manual
==========================

Everyone should read *Note MPFR Basics::.  If you need to install the
library yourself, you need to read *Note Installing MPFR::, too.

   The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it
is probably a good idea to glance through it.

2 Installing MPFR
*****************

2.1 How to install
==================

Here are the steps needed to install the library on Unix systems (more
details are provided in the `INSTALL' file):

  1. To build MPFR, you first have to install GNU MP (version 4.1 or
     higher) on your computer.  You need a C compiler, preferably GCC,
     but any reasonable compiler should work.  And you need a standard
     Unix `make' program, plus some other standard Unix utility
     programs.

  2. In the MPFR build directory, type `./configure'

     This will prepare the build and setup the options according to
     your system.  If you get error messages, you might check that you
     use the same compiler and compile options as for GNU MP (see the
     `INSTALL' file).

  3. `make'

     This will compile MPFR, and create a library archive file
     `libmpfr.a' in the working directory. No dynamic library is
     provided yet.

  4. `make check'

     This will make sure MPFR was built correctly.  If you get error
     messages, please report this to `mpfr@loria.fr'.  (*Note Reporting
     Bugs::, for information on what to include in useful bug reports.)

  5. `make install'

     This will copy the files `mpfr.h' and `mpf2mpfr.h' to the directory
     `/usr/local/include', the file `libmpfr.a' to the directory
     `/usr/local/lib', and the file `mpfr.info' to the directory
     `/usr/local/info' (or if you passed the `--prefix' option to
     `configure', using the prefix directory given as argument to
     `--prefix' instead of `/usr/local').

2.2 Other make targets
======================

There are some other useful make targets:

   * `mpfr.info' or `info'

     Create an info version of the manual, in `mpfr.info'.

   * `mpfr.dvi' or `dvi'

     Create a DVI version of the manual, in `mpfr.dvi'.

   * `mpfr.ps'

     Create a Postscript version of the manual, in `mpfr.ps'.

   * `clean'

     Delete all object files and archive files, but not the
     configuration files.

   * `distclean'

     Delete all files not included in the distribution.

   * `uninstall'

     Delete all files copied by `make install'.

2.3 Known Build Problems
========================

MPFR suffers from all bugs from the GNU MP library, plus many more.

   Please report other problems to `mpfr@loria.fr'.  *Note Reporting
Bugs::.  Some bug fixes are available on the MPFR web page
`http://www.mpfr.org/'.

2.4 Getting the Latest Version of MPFR

3 Reporting Bugs
****************

If you think you have found a bug in the MPFR library, first have a
look on the MPFR web page `http://www.mpfr.org/': perhaps this bug is
already known, in which case you may find there a workaround for it.
Otherwise, please investigate and report it. We have made this library
available to you, and it is not to ask too much from you, to ask you to
report the bugs that you find.

   There are a few things you should think about when you put your bug
report together.

   You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
reproduce the bug.  Include instructions on how to run the test case.

   You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if
the results printed are incorrect and in that case, in what way.

   Please include compiler version information in your bug report.
This can be extracted using `cc -V' on some machines, or, if you're
using gcc, `gcc -v'.  Also, include the output from `uname -a'.

   If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we won't
do anything about it (aside of chiding you to send better bug reports).

   Send your bug report to: `mpfr@loria.fr'.

   If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright
incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please send a note
to the same address.

4 MPFR Basics
*************

All declarations needed to use MPFR are collected in the include file
`mpfr.h'.  It is designed to work with both C and C++ compilers.  You
should include that file in any program using the MPFR library:

#include <mpfr.h>

4.1 Nomenclature and Types
==========================

A "floating-point number" or "float" for short, is an arbitrary
precision mantissa with a limited precision exponent. The C data type
for such objects is `mpfr_t'. A floating-point number can have three
special values: Not-a-Number (NaN) or plus or minus Infinity. NaN
represents an uninitialized object, the result of an invalid operation
(like 0 divided by 0), or a value that cannot be determined (like
+Infinity minus +Infinity). Moreover, like in the IEEE 754-1985
standard, zero is signed, i.e. there are both +0 and -0; the behavior
is the same as in the IEEE 754-1985 standard and it is generalized to
the other functions supported by MPFR.

The "precision" is the number of bits used to represent the mantissa of
a floating-point number; the corresponding C data type is `mp_prec_t'.
The precision can be any integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and
`MPFR_PREC_MAX'. In the current implementation, `MPFR_PREC_MIN' is
equal to 2.

The "rounding mode" specifies the way to round the result of a
floating-point operation, in case the exact result can not be
represented exactly in the destination mantissa; the corresponding C
data type is `mp_rnd_t'.

A "limb" means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a
single word.  (We chose this word because a limb of the human body is
analogous to a digit, only larger, and containing several digits.)
Normally a limb contains 32 or 64 bits.  The C data type for a limb is
`mp_limb_t'.

4.2 Function Classes
====================

There is only one class of functions in the MPFR library:

  1. Functions for floating-point arithmetic, with names beginning with
     `mpfr_'.  The associated type is `mpfr_t'.

4.3 MPFR Variable Conventions
=============================

As a general rule, all MPFR functions expect output arguments before
input arguments.  This notation is based on an analogy with the
assignment operator.

   MPFR allows you to use the same variable for both input and output
in the same expression.  For example, the main function for
floating-point multiplication, `mpfr_mul', can be used like this:
`mpfr_mul (x, x, x, rnd_mode)'.  This computes the square of X with
rounding mode `rnd_mode' and puts the result back in X.

   Before you can assign to an MPFR variable, you need to initialize it
by calling one of the special initialization functions.  When you're
done with a variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the
functions for that purpose.

   A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared out
between each initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it
may be assigned to any number of times.

   For efficiency reasons, avoid to initialize and clear out a variable
in loops.  Instead, initialize it before entering the loop, and clear
it out after the loop has exited.

   You don't need to be concerned about allocating additional space for
MPFR variables, since any variable has a mantissa of fixed size.  Hence
unless you change its precision, or clear and reinitialize it, a
floating-point variable will have the same allocated space during all
its life.

4.4 Rounding modes.
===================

The following four rounding modes are supported:

   * `GMP_RNDN': round to nearest

   * `GMP_RNDZ': round towards zero

   * `GMP_RNDU': round towards plus infinity

   * `GMP_RNDD': round towards minus infinity

   The `round to nearest' mode works as in the IEEE 754-1985 standard:
in case the number to be rounded lies exactly in the middle of two
representable numbers, it is rounded to the one with the least
significant bit set to zero.  For example, the number 5/2, which is
represented by (10.1) in binary, is rounded to (10.0)=2 with a
precision of two bits, and not to (11.0)=3.  This rule avoids the
"drift" phenomenon mentioned by Knuth in volume 2 of The Art of
Computer Programming (Section 4.2.2).

   Most MPFR functions take as first argument the destination variable,
as second and following arguments the input variables, as last argument
a rounding mode, and have a return value of type `int', called the
"ternary value". The value stored in the destination variable is
exactly rounded, i.e. MPFR behaves as if it computed the result with an
infinite precision, then rounded it to the precision of this variable.
The input variables are regarded as exact (in particular, their
precision does not affect the result).

   Unless documented otherwise, functions returning an `int' return a
ternary value.  If the ternary value is zero, it means that the value
stored in the destination variable is the exact result of the
corresponding mathematical function. If the ternary value is positive
(resp. negative), it means the value stored in the destination variable
is greater (resp. lower) than the exact result. For example with the
`GMP_RNDU' rounding mode, the ternary value is usually positive, except
when the result is exact, in which case it is zero. In the case of an
infinite result, it is considered as inexact when it was obtained by
overflow, and exact otherwise. A NaN result (Not-a-Number) always
corresponds to an exact return value.  The opposite of a returned
ternary value is guaranteed to be representable in an `int'.

5 MPFR Interface
****************

The floating-point functions expect arguments of type `mpfr_t'.

   The MPFR floating-point functions have an interface that is similar
to the GNU MP integer functions.  The function prefix for
floating-point operations is `mpfr_'.

   There is one significant characteristic of floating-point numbers
that has motivated a difference between this function class and other
GNU MP function classes: the inherent inexactness of floating-point
arithmetic.  The user has to specify the precision for each variable.
A computation that assigns a variable will take place with the
precision of the assigned variable; the cost of that computation should
not depend from the precision of variables used as input (on average).

   The semantics of a calculation in MPFR is specified as follows:
Compute the requested operation exactly (with "infinite accuracy"), and
round the result to the precision of the destination variable, with the
given rounding mode.  The MPFR floating-point functions are intended to
be a smooth extension of the IEEE 754-1985 arithmetic. The results
obtained on one computer should not differ from the results obtained on
a computer with a different word size.

   MPFR does not keep track of the accuracy of a computation. This is
left to the user or to a higher layer.  As a consequence, if two
variables are used to store only a few significant bits, and their
product is stored in a variable with large precision, then MPFR will
still compute the result with full precision.

5.1 Initialization Functions
============================

An `mpfr_t' object must be initialized before storing the first value in
it.  The functions `mpfr_init' and `mpfr_init2' are used for that
purpose.

 -- Function: void mpfr_init2 (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Initialize X, set its precision to be *exactly* PREC bits and its
     value to NaN. (Warning: the corresponding `mpf' functions
     initialize to zero instead.)

     Normally, a variable should be initialized once only or at least
     be cleared, using `mpfr_clear', between initializations.  To
     change the precision of a variable which has already been
     initialized, use `mpfr_set_prec'.  The precision PREC must be an
     integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX' (otherwise the
     behavior is undefined).

 -- Function: void mpfr_clear (mpfr_t X)
     Free the space occupied by X.  Make sure to call this function for
     all `mpfr_t' variables when you are done with them.

 -- Function: void mpfr_init (mpfr_t X)
     Initialize X and set its value to NaN.

     Normally, a variable should be initialized once only or at least
     be cleared, using `mpfr_clear', between initializations.  The
     precision of X is the default precision, which can be changed by a
     call to `mpfr_set_default_prec'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_default_prec (mp_prec_t PREC)
     Set the default precision to be *exactly* PREC bits.  The
     precision of a variable means the number of bits used to store its
     mantissa.  All subsequent calls to `mpfr_init' will use this
     precision, but previously initialized variables are unaffected.
     This default precision is set to 53 bits initially.  The precision
     can be any integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX'.

 -- Function: mp_prec_t mpfr_get_default_prec (void)
     Return the default MPFR precision in bits.

   Here is an example on how to initialize floating-point variables:

     {
       mpfr_t x, y;
       mpfr_init (x);			/* use default precision */
       mpfr_init2 (y, 256);		/* precision _exactly_ 256 bits */
       ...
       /* When the program is about to exit, do ... */
       mpfr_clear (x);
       mpfr_clear (y);
     }

   The following functions are useful for changing the precision during
a calculation.  A typical use would be for adjusting the precision
gradually in iterative algorithms like Newton-Raphson, making the
computation precision closely match the actual accurate part of the
numbers.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_prec (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Reset the precision of X to be *exactly* PREC bits, and set its
     value to NaN.  The previous value stored in X is lost. It is
     equivalent to a call to `mpfr_clear(x)' followed by a call to
     `mpfr_init2(x, prec)', but more efficient as no allocation is done
     in case the current allocated space for the mantissa of X is
     enough.  The precision PREC can be any integer between
     `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX'.

     In case you want to keep the previous value stored in X, use
     `mpfr_prec_round' instead.

 -- Function: mp_prec_t mpfr_get_prec (mpfr_t X)
     Return the precision actually used for assignments of X, i.e. the
     number of bits used to store its mantissa.

5.2 Assignment Functions
========================

These functions assign new values to already initialized floats (*note
Initialization Functions::). When using any functions using `intmax_t',
you must include `<stdint.h>' or `<inttypes.h>' before `mpfr.h', to
allow `mpfr.h' to define prototypes for these functions.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_ui (mpfr_t ROP, unsigned long int OP,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_si (mpfr_t ROP, long int OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_uj (mpfr_t ROP, uintmax_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_sj (mpfr_t ROP, intmax_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_d (mpfr_t ROP, double OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_ld (mpfr_t ROP, long double OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_z (mpfr_t ROP, mpz_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_q (mpfr_t ROP, mpq_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_f (mpfr_t ROP, mpf_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the value of ROP from OP, rounded towards the given direction
     RND.  Note that the input 0 is converted to +0 by `mpfr_set_ui',
     `mpfr_set_si', `mpfr_set_sj', `mpfr_set_uj', `mpfr_set_z',
     `mpfr_set_q' and `mpfr_set_f', regardless of the rounding mode.
     If the system doesn't support the IEEE-754 standard, `mpfr_set_d'
     and `mpfr_set_ld' might not preserve the signed zeros.
     `mpfr_set_q' might not be able to work if the numerator (or the
     denominator) can not be representable as a `mpfr_t'.

     Note: If you want to store a floating-point constant to a `mpfr_t',
     you should use `mpfr_set_str' instead of `mpfr_set_d' or
     `mpfr_set_ld'. Otherwise the floating-point constant will be first
     converted into a reduced-precision (e.g., 53-bit) binary number
     before MPFR can work with it.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_ui_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, unsigned long int OP,
          mp_exp_t E, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_si_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, long int OP, mp_exp_t
          E, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_uj_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, uintmax_t OP, intmax_t
          E, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_sj_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, intmax_t OP, intmax_t
          E, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the value of ROP from OP multiplied by two to the power E,
     rounded towards the given direction RND.  Note that the input 0 is
     converted to +0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_str (mpfr_t ROP, const char *S, int BASE,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the value of the whole string S in base BASE, rounded
     in the direction RND.  See the documentation of `mpfr_strtofr' for
     a detailed description of the valid string formats.  This function
     returns 0 if the entire string up to the final null character is a
     valid number in base BASE; otherwise it returns -1, and ROP may
     have changed.

 -- Function: int mpfr_strtofr (mpfr_t ROP, const char *NPTR, char
          **ENDPTR, int BASE, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Read a floating point number from a string NPTR in base BASE,
     rounded in the direction RND. If successful, the  result is stored
     in ROP and `*ENDPTR' points to the  character just after those
     parsed. If STR doesn't start with a  valid number then ROP is set
     to zero and the value of NPTR  is stored in the location
     referenced by ENDPTR.

     Parsing follows the standard C `strtod' function.  This means
     optional  leading whitespace, an optional `+' or `-', mantissa
     digits, and an  optional exponent consisting of an `e' or `E' (if
     BASE <= 10) or `@', an optional sign, and digits.   A hex mantissa
     can be  given with a leading `0x' or `0X', in which case `p' or
     `P' may introduce an optional binary exponent. A binary  mantissa
     can be given with a leading `0b' or `0B', in which case  `e', `E',
     `p', `P' or `@' may introduce the  binary exponent.

     In addition `infinity', `inf' (if BASE <= 10)  or `@inf@' with an
     optional sign, or `nan',  `nan(n-char-sequence)' (if BASE <= 10),
     `@nan@'  or `@nan@(n-char-sequence)' all non case significant, can
     be given.   A `n-char-sequence' is a string containing only digits
     (0, 1, 2, ..., 9)  and non-digits (_, a, b, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z).

     There must be at least one digit in the mantissa for the number to
     be valid.  If an exponent has no digits it's ignored and parsing
     stops after the mantissa.  If an `0x', `0X', `0b' or  `0B' is not
     followed by hexadecimal/binary digits, parsing stops  after the
     first `0':  the subject sequence  is  defined  as  the  longest
     initial  subsequence  of  the  input  string, starting with the
     first  non-white-space character, that is  of  the  expected  form.
     The  subject  sequence  contains  no characters if the input
     string is not of the expected form.

     Note that in the hex format the exponent `P' represents a power of
     2,  whereas `@' represents a power of the base (i.e. 16).

     If the argument BASE is different from 0, it must be in the range 2
     to 36.   Case is ignored; upper-case and lower-case letters have
     the same  value

     If `base' is 0, then it tries to identify the used base: if the
     mantissa begins with the `0x' prefix, it assumes that BASE is 16.
     If it begins with `0b', it assumes that BASE is 2. Otherwise, it
     assumes it is 10.

     It returns a usual ternary value.   If ENDPTR is not a null
     pointer, a pointer to the character after  the last character used
     in the conversion is stored in the location  referenced by ENDPTR.


 -- Function: void mpfr_set_inf (mpfr_t X, int SIGN)
 -- Function: void mpfr_set_nan (mpfr_t X)
     Set the variable X to infinity or NaN (Not-a-Number) respectively.
     In `mpfr_set_inf', X is set to plus infinity iff SIGN is
     nonnegative.

 -- Function: void mpfr_swap (mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y)
     Swap the values X and Y efficiently. Warning: the precisions are
     exchanged too; in case the precisions are different, `mpfr_swap'
     is thus not equivalent to three `mpfr_set' calls using a third
     auxiliary variable.

5.4 Conversion Functions
========================

 -- Function: double mpfr_get_d (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: long double mpfr_get_ld (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `double' (respectively `long double'), using the
     rounding mode RND.  If the system doesn't support IEEE 754
     standard, this function  might not preserve the signed zeros.

 -- Function: double mpfr_get_d_2exp (long *EXP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Return D and set EXP such that 0.5<=abs(D)<1 and D times 2 raised
     to EXP equals OP rounded to double precision, using the given
     rounding mode.

 -- Function: long mpfr_get_si (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: unsigned long mpfr_get_ui (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: intmax_t mpfr_get_sj (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: uintmax_t mpfr_get_uj (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `long', an `unsigned long', an `intmax_t' or an
     `uintmax_t' (respectively) after rounding it with respect to RND.
     If OP is NaN, the result is undefined.  If OP is too big for the
     return type, it returns the maximum or the minimum of the
     corresponding C type, depending on the direction of the overflow.
     The flag erange is set too.  See also `mpfr_fits_slong_p',
     `mpfr_fits_ulong_p', `mpfr_fits_intmax_p' and
     `mpfr_fits_uintmax_p'.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_z_exp (mpz_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
     Put the scaled mantissa of OP (regarded as an integer, with the
     precision of OP) into ROP, and return the exponent EXP (which may
     be outside the current exponent range) such that OP exactly equals
     ROP multiplied by two exponent EXP.  If the exponent is not
     representable in the `mp_exp_t' type, the behavior is undefined.

 -- Function: void mpfr_get_z (mpz_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a `mpz_t', after rounding it with respect to RND. If
     OP is NaN or Inf, the result is undefined.

 -- Function: char * mpfr_get_str (char *STR, mp_exp_t *EXPPTR, int
          BASE, size_t N, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Convert OP to a string of digits in base BASE, with rounding in
     the direction RND. The base may vary from 2 to 36.

     The generated string is a fraction, with an implicit radix point
     immediately to the left of the first digit.  For example, the
     number -3.1416 would be returned as "-31416" in the string and 1
     written at EXPPTR.  If RND is to nearest, and OP is exactly in the
     middle of two possible outputs, the one with an even last digit is
     chosen (for an odd base, this may not correspond to an even
     mantissa).

     If N is zero, the number of digits of the mantissa is determined
     automatically from the precision of OP and the value of BASE.
     Warning: this functionality may disappear or change in future
     versions.  Otherwise generate exactly N significant digits, which
     must be at least 2.

     If STR is a null pointer, space for the mantissa is allocated using
     the current allocation function, and a pointer to the string is
     returned.  To free the returned string, you must use
     `mpfr_free_str'.

     If STR is not a null pointer, it should point to a block of storage
     large enough for the mantissa, i.e., at least `max(N + 2, 7)'.
     The extra two bytes are for a possible minus sign, and for the
     terminating null character.

     If N is 0, note that the space requirements for STR in this case
     will be impossible for the user to predetermine. Therefore, one
     needs to pass a null pointer for the string argument whenever N is
     0.

     If the input number is an ordinary number, the exponent is written
     through the pointer EXPPTR (the current minimal exponent for 0).

     A pointer to the string is returned, unless there is an error, in
     which case a null pointer is returned.

 -- Function: void mpfr_free_str (char *STR)
     Free a string allocated by `mpfr_get_str' using the current
     unallocation function (preliminary interface).  The block is
     assumed to be `strlen(STR)+1' bytes.  For more information about
     how it is done: *note Custom Allocation: (gmp)Custom Allocation.

 -- Function: int mpfr_fits_slong_p (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_fits_uint_p (mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)

     rounded to an integer in the direction RND.

 -- Function: int mpfr_agm (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the arithmetic-geometric mean of OP1 and OP2, rounded
     in the direction RND.  The arithmetic-geometric mean is the common
     limit of the sequences u[n] and v[n], where u[0]=OP1, v[0]=OP2,
     u[n+1] is the arithmetic mean of u[n] and v[n], and v[n+1] is the
     geometric mean of u[n] and v[n].  If any operand is negative, the
     return value is NaN.

 -- Function: int mpfr_hypot (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Set ROP to the Euclidean norm of X and Y, i.e.  the square root of

     Set ROP to the logarithm of 2, the value of Pi, the value of
     Euler's constant 0.577..., respectively, rounded in the direction
     RND. These functions cache the computed values to avoid other
     calculations if a lower or equal precision is requested. To free
     these caches, use `mpfr_free_cache'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_free_cache (void)
     Free the cache used by the functions computing constants if needed
     (currently `mpfr_const_log2', `mpfr_const_pi' and
     `mpfr_const_euler').

 -- Function: int mpfr_sum (mpfr_t ROP, const mpfr_t* const TAB[],
          unsigned long N, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set RET to the sum of all elements of TAB whose size is N, rounded
     in the direction RND. Warning, TAB is a table of pointers to
     mpfr_t, not a table of mpfr_t (preliminary interface).

5.8 Input and Output Functions
==============================

This section describes functions that perform input from an input/output
stream, and functions that output to an input/output stream.  Passing a
null pointer for a STREAM argument to any of these functions will make
them read from `stdin' and write to `stdout', respectively.

   When using any of these functions, you must include the `<stdio.h>'
standard header before `mpfr.h', to allow `mpfr.h' to define prototypes
for these functions.

 -- Function: size_t mpfr_out_str (FILE *STREAM, int BASE, size_t N,
          mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Output OP on stream STREAM, as a string of digits in base BASE,
     rounded in the direction RND.  The base may vary from 2 to 36.
     Print N significant digits exactly, or if N is 0, the maximum
     number of digits accurately representable by OP (this feature may
     disappear).

     In addition to the significant digits, a decimal point at the
     right of the first digit and a trailing exponent in base 10, in
     the form `eNNN', are printed. If BASE is greater than 10, `@' will
     be used instead of `e' as exponent delimiter.

     Return the number of bytes written, or if an error occurred,
     return 0.

 -- Function: size_t mpfr_inp_str (mpfr_t ROP, FILE *STREAM, int BASE,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Input a string in base BASE from stream STREAM, rounded in the
     direction RND, and put the read float in ROP.

     This function reads a word (defined as a sequence of characters
     between whitespace) and parses it using `mpfr_set_str' (it may
     change).  See the documentation of `mpfr_strtofr' for a detailed
     description of the valid string formats.

     Return the number of bytes read, or if an error occurred, return 0.

5.9 Integer Related Functions
=============================

 -- Function: int mpfr_rint (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_ceil (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_floor (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_round (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_trunc (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP)
     Set ROP to OP rounded to an integer.  `mpfr_rint' rounds to the
     nearest representable integer in the given rounding mode,
     `mpfr_ceil' rounds to the next higher or equal representable
     integer, `mpfr_floor' to the next lower or equal representable
     integer, `mpfr_round' to the nearest representable integer,
     rounding halfway cases away from zero, and `mpfr_trunc' to the
     next representable integer towards zero.

     The returned value is zero when the result is exact, positive when
     it is greater than the original value of OP, and negative when it
     is smaller.  More precisely, the returned value is 0 when OP is an
     integer representable in ROP, 1 or -1 when OP is an integer that
     is not representable in ROP, 2 or -2 when OP is not an integer.

     Note that `mpfr_round' is different from `mpfr_rint' called with
     the rounding to the nearest mode (where halfway cases are rounded
     to an even integer or mantissa). Note also that no double rounding
     is performed; for instance, 4.5 (100.1 in binary) is rounded by
     `mpfr_round' to 4 (100 in binary) in 2-bit precision, though
     `round(4.5)' is equal to 5 and 5 (101 in binary) is rounded to 6
     (110 in binary) in 2-bit precision.

 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_ceil (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_floor (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_round (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_rint_trunc (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to OP rounded to an integer.  `mpfr_rint_ceil' rounds to
     the next higher or equal integer, `mpfr_rint_floor' to the next
     lower or equal integer, `mpfr_rint_round' to the nearest integer,
     rounding halfway cases away from zero, and `mpfr_rint_trunc' to
     the next integer towards zero.  If the result is not
     representable, it is rounded in the direction RND.  The returned
     value is the ternary value associated with the considered
     round-to-integer function (regarded in the same way as any other
     mathematical function).

 -- Function: int mpfr_frac (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP, mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the fractional part of OP, having the same sign as OP,
     rounded in the direction RND (unlike in `mpfr_rint', RND affects
     only how the exact fractional part is rounded, not how the
     fractional part is generated).

 -- Function: int mpfr_integer_p (mpfr_t OP)
     Return non-zero iff OP is an integer.

5.10 Miscellaneous Functions
============================

 -- Function: void mpfr_nexttoward (mpfr_t X, mpfr_t Y)
     If X or Y is NaN, set X to NaN. Otherwise, if X is different from
     Y, replace X by the next floating-point number (with the precision
     of X and the current exponent range) in the direction of Y, if
     there is one (the infinite values are seen as the smallest and
     largest floating-point numbers). If the result is zero, it keeps
     the same sign. No underflow or overflow is generated.

 -- Function: void mpfr_nextabove (mpfr_t X)
     Equivalent to `mpfr_nexttoward' where Y is plus infinity.

 -- Function: void mpfr_nextbelow (mpfr_t X)
     Equivalent to `mpfr_nexttoward' where Y is minus infinity.

 -- Function: int mpfr_min (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the minimum of OP1 and OP2. If OP1 and OP2 are both
     NaN, then ROP is set to NaN. If OP1 or OP2 is NaN, then ROP is set
     to the numeric value. If OP1 and OP2 are zeros of different signs,
     then ROP is set to -0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_max (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set ROP to the maximum of OP1 and OP2. If OP1 and OP2 are both
     NaN, then ROP is set to NaN. If OP1 or OP2 is NaN, then ROP is set
     to the numeric value. If OP1 and OP2 are zeros of different signs,
     then ROP is set to +0.

 -- Function: int mpfr_urandomb (mpfr_t ROP, gmp_randstate_t STATE)
     Generate a uniformly distributed random float in the interval 0 <=
     ROP < 1.  Return 0, unless the exponent is not in the current
     exponent range, in which case ROP is set to NaN and a non-zero
     value is returned.

 -- Function: void mpfr_random (mpfr_t ROP)
     Generate a uniformly distributed random float in the interval 0 <=
     ROP < 1.  This function is deprecated; `mpfr_urandomb' should be
     used instead.

 -- Function: void mpfr_random2 (mpfr_t ROP, mp_size_t SIZE, mp_exp_t
          EXP)
     Generate a random float of at most SIZE limbs, with long strings of
     zeros and ones in the binary representation. The exponent of the
     number is in the interval -EXP to EXP.  This function is useful for
     testing functions and algorithms, since this kind of random
     numbers have proven to be more likely to trigger corner-case bugs.
     Negative random numbers are generated when SIZE is negative.  Put
     +0 in ROP when size if zero.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_exp (mpfr_t X)
     Get the exponent of X, assuming that X is a non-zero ordinary
     number. The return value for Nan, Infinity or Zero is undefined.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_exp (mpfr_t X, mp_exp_t E)
     Set the exponent of X if E is in the current exponent range, and
     return 0 (even if X is not a non-zero ordinary number); otherwise,
     return a non-zero value.

 -- Function: const char * mpfr_get_version (void)
     Return the MPFR version, as a null-terminated string.

 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_MINOR
 -- Macro: MPFR_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL
     `MPFR_VERSION' is the version of MPFR as a preprocessing constant.
     `MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR', `MPFR_VERSION_MINOR' and
     `MPFR_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL' are respectively the major, minor and
     patch level of MPFR version, as preprocessing constants.

 -- Macro: long MPFR_VERSION_NUM (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCHLEVEL)
     Create an integer in the same format as used by `MPFR_VERSION'
     from the given MAJOR, MINOR and PATCHLEVEL.  Here is an example of
     how to check the MPFR version at compile time:
          #if (!defined(MPFR_VERSION) || (MPFR_VERSION<MPFR_VERSION_NUM(2,1,0)))
          # error "Wrong MPFR version."
          #endif

5.11 Rounding Modes
===================

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode (mp_rnd_t RND)
     Set the default rounding mode to RND.  The default rounding mode
     is to nearest initially.

 -- Function: mp_rnd_t mpfr_get_default_rounding_mode (void)
     Get the default rounding mode.

 -- Function: int mpfr_prec_round (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC, mp_rnd_t
          RND)
     Round X according to RND with precision PREC, which must be an
     integer between `MPFR_PREC_MIN' and `MPFR_PREC_MAX' (otherwise the
     behavior is undefined).  If PREC is greater or equal to the
     precision of X, then new space is allocated for the mantissa, and
     it is filled with zeros.  Otherwise, the mantissa is rounded to
     precision PREC with the given direction. In both cases, the
     precision of X is changed to PREC.

 -- Function: int mpfr_round_prec (mpfr_t X, mp_rnd_t RND, mp_prec_t
          PREC)
     [This function is obsolete. Please use `mpfr_prec_round' instead.]

 -- Function: const char * mpfr_print_rnd_mode (mp_rnd_t RND)
     Return the input string (GMP_RNDD, GMP_RNDU, GMP_RNDN, GMP_RNDZ)
     corresponding to the rounding mode RND or a null pointer if RND is
     an invalid rounding mode.

5.12 Exceptions
===============

Note: Overflow handling is still experimental and currently implemented
partially. If an overflow occurs internally at the wrong place,
anything can happen (crash, wrong results, etc).

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emin (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emax (void)
     Return the (current) smallest and largest exponents allowed for a
     floating-point variable. The smallest positive value of a
     floating-point variable is one half times 2 raised to the smallest
     exponent and the largest value has the form (1 - epsilon) times 2
     raised to the largest exponent.

 -- Function: int mpfr_set_emin (mp_exp_t EXP)
 -- Function: int mpfr_set_emax (mp_exp_t EXP)
     Set the smallest and largest exponents allowed for a
     floating-point variable.  Return a non-zero value when EXP is not
     in the range accepted by the implementation (in that case the
     smallest or largest exponent is not changed), and zero otherwise.
     If the user changes the exponent range, it is her/his
     responsibility to check that all current floating-point variables
     are in the new allowed range (for example using
     `mpfr_check_range'), otherwise the subsequent behavior will be
     undefined, in the sense of the ISO C standard.

 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emin_min (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emin_max (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emax_min (void)
 -- Function: mp_exp_t mpfr_get_emax_max (void)
     Return the minimum and maximum of the smallest and largest
     exponents allowed for `mpfr_set_emin' and `mpfr_set_emax'. These
     values are implementation dependent; it is possible to create a non
     portable program by writing `mpfr_set_emax(mpfr_get_emax_max())'
     and `mpfr_set_emin(mpfr_get_emin_min())' since the values of the
     smallest and largest exponents become implementation dependent.

 -- Function: int mpfr_check_range (mpfr_t X, int T, mp_rnd_t RND)
     This function forces X to be in the current range of acceptable
     values, T being the current ternary value: negative if X is
     smaller than the exact value, positive if X is larger than the
     exact value and zero if X is exact (before the call). It generates
     an underflow or an overflow if the exponent of X is outside the
     current allowed range; the value of T may be used to avoid a
     double rounding. This function returns zero if the rounded result
     is equal to the exact one, a positive value if the rounded result
     is larger than the exact one, a negative value if the rounded
     result is smaller than the exact one. Note that unlike most
     functions, the result is compared to the exact one, not the input
     value X, i.e. the ternary value is propagated.

 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_underflow (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_overflow (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_nanflag (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_inexflag (void)
 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_erangeflag (void)
     Clear the underflow, overflow, invalid, inexact and erange flags.

 -- Function: void mpfr_clear_flags (void)
     Clear all global flags (underflow, overflow, inexact, invalid,
     erange).

 -- Function: int mpfr_underflow_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_overflow_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_nanflag_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_inexflag_p (void)
 -- Function: int mpfr_erangeflag_p (void)
     Return the corresponding (underflow, overflow, invalid, inexact,
     erange) flag, which is non-zero iff the flag is set.

5.13 Advanced Functions
=======================

All the given interfaces are preliminary. They might change
incompatibly in future revisions.

 -- Macro: MPFR_DECL_INIT (NAME, PREC)
     This macro declares NAME as an automatic variable of type `mpfr_t',
     initializes it and sets its precision to be *exactly* PREC bits
     and its value to NaN. NAME must be a valid identifier.  You must
     use this macro in the declaration section. This macro is much
     faster than using `mpfr_init2' but has some drawbacks:

        * You *must not* call `mpfr_clear' with variables created with
          this macro (The storage is allocated at the point of
          declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.).

        * You *can not* change their precision.

        * You *should not* create variables with huge precision with
          this macro.

        * Your compiler must support `Non-Constant Initializers'
          (standard in C++ and ISO C99) and `Token Pasting' (standard
          in ISO C89). If PREC is not a compiler constant, your compiler
          must support `Variable-length automatic arrays' (standard in
          ISO C99).  `GCC 2.95.3' supports all these features.

 -- Function: void mpfr_inits (mpfr_t X, ...)
     Initialize all the `mpfr_t' variables of the given `va_list', set
     their precision to be the default precision and their value to NaN.
     See `mpfr_init' for more details.  The `va_list' is assumed to be
     composed only of type `mpfr_t'.  It begins from X. It ends when it
     encounters a null pointer.

 -- Function: void mpfr_inits2 (mp_prec_t PREC, mpfr_t X, ...)
     Initialize all the `mpfr_t' variables of the given `va_list', set
     their precision to be *exactly* PREC bits and their value to NaN.
     See `mpfr_init2' for more details.  The `va_list' is assumed to be
     composed only of type `mpfr_t'.  It begins from X. It ends when it
     encounters a null pointer.

 -- Function: void mpfr_clears (mpfr_t X, ...)
     Free the space occupied by all the `mpfr_t' variables of the given
     `va_list'. See `mpfr_clear' for more details.  The `va_list' is
     assumed to be composed only of type `mpfr_t'.  It begins from X.
     It ends when it encounters a null pointer.

   Here is an example of how to use multiple initialization functions:

     {
       mpfr_t x, y, z, t;
       mpfr_inits2 (256, x, y, z, t, (void *) 0);
       ...
       mpfr_clears (x, y, z, t, (void *) 0);

5.14 Compatibility with MPF
===========================

A header file `mpf2mpfr.h' is included in the distribution of MPFR for
compatibility with the GNU MP class MPF.  After inserting the following
two lines after the `#include <gmp.h>' line,

#include <mpfr.h>
#include <mpf2mpfr.h>
 any program written for MPF can be compiled directly with MPFR without
any changes.  All operations are then performed with the default MPFR
rounding mode, which can be reset with `mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode'.

   Warning: the `mpf_init' and `mpf_init2' functions initialize to
zero, whereas the corresponding `mpfr' functions initialize to NaN:
this is useful to detect uninitialized values, but is slightly
incompatible with `mpf'.

 -- Function: void mpfr_set_prec_raw (mpfr_t X, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Reset the precision of X to be *exactly* PREC bits.  The only
     difference with `mpfr_set_prec' is that PREC is assumed to be
     small enough so that the mantissa fits into the current allocated
     memory space for X. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

 -- Function: int mpfr_eq (mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2, unsigned long int
          OP3)
     Return non-zero if OP1 and OP2 are both non-zero ordinary numbers
     with the same exponent and the same first OP3 bits, both zero, or
     both infinities of the same sign. Return zero otherwise. This
     function is defined for compatibility with `mpf', but does not
     make much sense.

 -- Function: void mpfr_reldiff (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, mpfr_t OP2,
          mp_rnd_t RND)
     Compute the relative difference between OP1 and OP2 and store the
     result in ROP.  This function does not guarantee the exact
     rounding on the relative difference; it just computes
     |OP1-OP2|/OP1, using the rounding mode RND for all operations and
     the precision of ROP.

 -- Function: int mpfr_mul_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, unsigned long
          int OP2, mp_rnd_t RND)
 -- Function: int mpfr_div_2exp (mpfr_t ROP, mpfr_t OP1, unsigned long
          int OP2, mp_rnd_t RND)
     See `mpfr_mul_2ui' and `mpfr_div_2ui'. These functions are only
     kept for compatibility with MPF.

5.15 Internals
==============

The following types and functions were mainly designed for the
implementation of `mpfr', but may be useful for users too.  However no
upward compatibility is guaranteed.  You may need to include
`mpfr-impl.h' to use them.

   The `mpfr_t' type consists of four fields.

   * The `_mpfr_prec' field is used to store the precision of the
     variable (in bits); this is not less than `MPFR_PREC_MIN'.

   * The `_mpfr_sign' field is used to store the sign of the variable.

   * The `_mpfr_exp' field stores the exponent.  An exponent of 0 means
     a radix point just above the most significant limb.  Non-zero
     values n are a multiplier 2^n relative to that point.  A NaN, an
     Infinity and a Zero are indicated by a special value of the
     exponent.

   * Finally, the `_mpfr_d' is a pointer to the limbs, least
     significant limbs stored first.  The number of limbs in use is
     controlled by `_mpfr_prec', namely
     ceil(`_mpfr_prec'/`mp_bits_per_limb').  Non-singular values always
     have the most significant bit of the most significant limb set to
     1.  When the precision does not correspond to a whole number of
     limbs, the excess bits at the low end of the data are zero.


 -- Function: int mpfr_can_round (mpfr_t B, mp_exp_t ERR, mp_rnd_t
          RND1, mp_rnd_t RND2, mp_prec_t PREC)
     Assuming B is an approximation of an unknown number X in the
     direction RND1 with error at most two to the power E(b)-ERR where
     E(b) is the exponent of B, return a non-zero value if one is able
     to round exactly X to precision PREC with the direction RND2, and
     0 otherwise (including for NaN and Inf).  This function *does not
     modify* its arguments.

 -- Function: double mpfr_get_d1 (mpfr_t OP)
     Convert OP to a `double', using the default MPFR rounding mode
     (see function `mpfr_set_default_rounding_mode'). This function is
     obsolete.

************

The main developers consist of Guillaume Hanrot, Vincent Lefèvre,
Patrick Pélissier and Paul Zimmermann.

   We would like to thank Jean-Michel Muller and Joris van der Hoeven
for very fruitful discussions at the beginning of that project,
Torbjörn Granlund and Kevin Ryde for their help about design issues,
and Nathalie Revol for her careful reading of a previous version of
this documentation.  Kevin Ryde did a tremendous job for the
portability of MPFR, and integrating it into GMP 4.x; alas the GMP
developers decided in January 2004 not to include MPFR any more.

   Sylvie Boldo from ENS-Lyon, France, contributed the functions
`mpfr_agm' and `mpfr_log'.  Emmanuel Jeandel, from ENS-Lyon too,
contributed the generic hypergeometric code in `generic.c', as well as
the `mpfr_exp3', a first implementation of the sine and cosine, and
improved versions of `mpfr_const_log2' and `mpfr_const_pi'.  Mathieu
Dutour contributed the functions `mpfr_atan' and `mpfr_asin', David
Daney contributed the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, the
base-2 exponential, and the factorial function. Fabrice Rouillier
contributed the original version of `mul_ui.c', the `gmp_op.c' file,
and helped to the Windows porting.  Jean-Luc Rémy contributed the
`mpfr_zeta' code.  Ludovic Meunier helped in the design of the
`mpfr_erf' code.

   The development of the MPFR library would not have been possible
without the continuous support of LORIA, INRIA and INRIA Lorraine.  The
development of MPFR was also supported by a grant (202F0659 00 MPN 121)
from the Conseil Régional de Lorraine in 2002.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
========================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
