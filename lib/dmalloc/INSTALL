How to Install the Library
==========================

To configure, compile, and install the library, follow these steps
carefully.

  1. Make sure you have the latest version of the library available
     from the home page at URL `http://dmalloc.com/'.

  2. You may want to edit or at least review the settings in
     `settings.dist' to tune specific features of the library.  The
     `configure' script will copy this file to `settings.h' which is
     where you should be adding per-architecture settings.

  3. Type `sh ./configure' to configure the library.  You may want to
     first examine the `config.help' file for some information about
     configure.  You may want to use the `--disable-cxx' option if you
     do not want the Makefile to build the C++ version of dmalloc.  You
     may want to use the `--enable-threads' option to build the
     threaded version of dmalloc.  You may want to use the
     `--enable-shlib' option to build the shared versions of the
     dmalloc libraries.  `sh ./configure --help' lists the available
     options to configure.  Configure should generate the `Makefile'
     and configuration files automatically.

  4. You may want to examine the `Makefile' and `conf.h' files created
     by configure to make sure it did its job correctly.

  5. You might want to tune the settings in `settings.h' file to tune
     the library to the local architecture.  This file contains relevant
     settings if you are using pthreads or another thread library.
     *Note Using With Threads::.  The `configure' script created this
     file from the `settings.dist' file.  Any permanent changes to these
     settings should made to the `settings.dist' file.  You then can run
     `config.status' to re-create the `settings.h' file.

  6. The `DMALLOC_SIZE' variable gets auto-configured in `dmalloc.h.2'
     but it may not generate correct settings for all systems.  You may
     have to alter the definitions in this file to get things to stop
     complaining when you go to compile about the size arguments to
     malloc routines.  Comments on this please.

  7. Typing `make' should be enough to build `libdmalloc.a', and
     `dmalloc' program.  If it does not work, please see if there are
     any notes in the contrib directory about your system-type.  If not
     and you figure your problem out, please send me some notes so
     future users can profit from your experiences.

     _NOTE_: You may experience some errors compiling some of the
     return.h assembly macros which attempt to determine the callers
     address for logging purposes.  You may want to first try disabling
     any compiler optimization flags.  If this doesn't work then you
     may need to disable the `USE_RETURN_MACROS' variable in the
     `settings.h' file.

     _NOTE_: The code is dependent on an ANSI-C compiler.  If the
     configure script gives the `WARNING' that you do not have an ANSI-C
     compiler, you may still be able to add some sort of option to your
     compiler to make it ANSI.  If there such is an option, please send
     it to the author so it can be added to the configure script.

  8. If you use threads and did not add the `--enable-threads' argument
     to configure, typing `make threads' should be enough to build
     `libdmallocth.a' which is the threaded version of the library.
     This may or may not work depending on the configuration scripts
     ability to detect your local thread functionality.  Feel free to
     send me mail with improvements.

     See the "Using With Threads" section for more information about the
     operation of the library with your threaded program.  *Note Using
     With Threads::.

  9. If you have a C++ compiler installed, the library should have
     automatically built `libdmallocxx.a' which is the C++ version of
     the library.  If it was not done automatically, you can build it by
     typing `make cxx'.  You should link this library into your C++
     programs instead of `libdmalloc.a'.  See the `dmallocc.cc' C++
     file which contains basic code to overload the `new', `new[]',
     `delete', and `delete[]' C++ operators.  My apologies on the
     minimal C++ support.  I am still living in a mostly C world.  Any
     help improving this interface without sacrificing portability
     would be appreciated.

 10. Typing `make light' should build and run the `dmalloc_t' test
     program through a set of light trials.  By default this will
     execute `dmalloc_t' 5 times - each time will execute 10,000 malloc
     operations in a very random manner.  Anal folks can type `make
     heavy' to up the ante.  Use `dmalloc_t --usage' for the list of all
     `dmalloc_t' options.

 11. Typing `make install' should install the `libdmalloc.a' library in
     `/usr/local/lib', the `dmalloc.h' include file in
     `/usr/local/include', and the `dmalloc' utility in
     `/usr/local/bin'.  You may also want to type `make installth' to
     install the thread library into place and/or `make installcc' to
     install the C++ library into place.

     You may have specified a `--prefix=PATH' option to configure in
     which case `/usr/local' will have been replaced with `PATH'.


   See the "Getting Started" section to get up and running with the
library.  *Note Getting Started::.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started with the Library
================================

This section should give you a quick idea on how to get going.
Basically, you need to do the following things to make use of the
library:

  1. Make sure you have the latest version of the library available
     from the home page at URL `http://dmalloc.com/'.

  2. Follow the installation instructions on how to configure, make,
     and install the library (i.e. type: `make install').  *Note
     Installation::.

  3. You need to make sure that the library configuration and build
     process above was able to locate one of the `on_exit' function,
     `atexit' function, or had compiler destructor support.  If one of
     these functions or support is available then the dmalloc library
     should be able to automatically shut itself down when the program
     exits.  This causes the memory statistics and unfreed information
     to be dumped to the log file.  However, if your system has none of
     the above, then you will need to call `dmalloc_shutdown' yourself
     before your program exits.

  4. Add an alias for dmalloc to your shell's rc file if supported.
     The idea is to have the shell capture the dmalloc program's output
     and adjust the environment.  Bash, ksh, and zsh users should add
     the following to their `.bashrc', `.profile', or `.zshrc' file
     respectively (notice the `-b' option for bourne shell output):

          function dmalloc { eval `command dmalloc -b $*`; }

     If your shell does not support the `command' function then try:

          function dmalloc { eval `\dmalloc -b $*`; }
     or
          function dmalloc { eval `/usr/local/bin/dmalloc -b $*`; }

     If you are _still_ using csh or tcsh, you should add the following
     to your `.cshrc' file (notice the `-C' option for c-shell output):

          alias dmalloc 'eval `\dmalloc -C \!*`'

     If you are using rc shell, you should add the following to your
     `.rcrc' file (notice the `-R' option for rc-shell output):

          fn dmalloc {eval `{/usr/local/bin/dmalloc $*}}

     By the way, if you are looking for a shell, I heartily recommend
     trying out zsh at URL `http://www.zsh.org/'.  It is a bourne shell
     written from scratch with much the same features as tcsh without
     the csh crap.

     _NOTE_: After you add the alias to the file you need to log out and
     log back in to have it take effect, or you can execute the above
     appropriate command on the command line.  If you enter `dmalloc
     runtime' and see any output with DMALLOC_OPTIONS in it then the
     alias did not work.

  5. Although not necessary, you may want to include `dmalloc.h' in
     your C files and recompile.  This will allow the library to report
     the file/line numbers of calls that generate problems.  *Note
     Allocation Macros::.  It should be inserted at the _bottom_ of
     your include files as to not conflict with wother includes.  You
     may want to ifdef it as well and compile with `cc -DDMALLOC ...':

          /* other includes above ^^^ */
          
          #ifdef DMALLOC
          #include "dmalloc.h"
          #endif

  6. Link the dmalloc library into your program.  The dmalloc library
     should probably be placed at or near the end of the library list.

  7. Enable the debugging features by typing `dmalloc -l logfile -i 100
     low' (for example).  This will:

        * set the malloc log path to `logfile' (`-l logfile')

        * have the library check itself every 100 iterations (`-i 100')

        * enable a number of debug features (`low').  You can also try
          `runtime' for minimal checking or `medium' or `high' for more
          extensive heap verification.


     `dmalloc --usage' will provide verbose usage info for the dmalloc
     program.  *Note Dmalloc Program::.

     You may also want to install the `dmallocrc' file in your home
     directory as `.dmallocrc'.  This allows you to add your own
     combination of debug tokens.  *Note RC File::.

  8. Run your program, examine the logfile that should have been
     created by dmalloc_shutdown, and use its information to help debug
     your program.  See the next section for help with this.  *Note
     Troubleshooting::.

Basic Description of Terms and Functions

File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Basic Definitions,  Next: Malloc Functions,  Prev: Allocation Basics,  Up: Allocation Basics

General Memory Terms and Concepts
---------------------------------

Any program can be divided into 2 logical parts: text and data.  Text is
the actual program code in machine-readable format and data is the
information that the text operates on when it is executing.  The data,
in turn, can be divided into 3 logical parts according to where it is
stored: "static", "stack", and "heap".

   Static data is the information whose storage space is compiled into
the program.

     /* global variables are allocated as static data */
     int numbers[10];
     
     main()
     {
             ...
     }

   Stack data is data allocated at runtime to hold information used
inside of functions.  This data is managed by the system in the space
called stack space.

     void foo()
     {
             /* this local variable is stored on the stack */
             float total;
             ...
     }
     
     main()
     {
             foo();
     }

   Heap data is also allocated at runtime and provides a programmer with
dynamic memory capabilities.

     main()
     {
             /* the address is stored on the stack */
             char * string;
             ...
     
             /*
              * Allocate a string of 10 bytes on the heap.  Store the
              * address in string which is on the stack.
              */
             string = (char *)malloc(10);
             ...
     
             /* de-allocate the heap memory now that we're done with it */
             (void)free(string);
             ...
     }

   It is the heap data that is managed by this library.

   Although the above is an example of how to use the malloc and free
commands, it is not a good example of why using the heap for runtime
storage is useful.

   Consider this: You write a program that reads a file into memory,
processes it, and displays results.  You would like to handle files with
arbitrary size (from 10 bytes to 1.2 megabytes and more).  One problem,
however, is that the entire file must be in memory at one time to do the
calculations.  You don't want to have to allocate 1.2 megabytes when you
might only be reading in a 10 byte file because it is wasteful of system
resources.  Also, you are worried that your program might have to handle
files of more than 1.2 megabytes.

   A solution: first check out the file's size and then, using the
heap-allocation routines, get enough storage to read the entire file
into memory.  The program will only be using the system resources
necessary for the job and you will be guaranteed that your program can
handle any sized file.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Malloc Functions,  Prev: Basic Definitions,  Up: Allocation Basics

Functionality Supported by All Malloc Libraries
-----------------------------------------------

All malloc libraries support 4 basic memory allocation commands.  These
include "malloc", "calloc", "realloc", and "free".  For more
information about their capabilities, check your system's manual pages
- in unix, do a `man 3 malloc'.

 - Function:
     void *malloc ( unsigned int SIZE )

     Usage: `pnt = (type *)malloc(size)'

     The malloc routine is the basic memory allocation routine.  It
     allocates an area of `size' bytes.  It will return a pointer to
     the space requested.


 - Function:
     void *calloc ( unsigned int NUMBER, unsigned int SIZE )

     Usage: `pnt = (type *)calloc(number, size)'

     The calloc routine allocates a certain `number' of items, each of
     `size' bytes, and returns a pointer to the space.  It is
     appropriate to pass in a `sizeof(type)' value as the size argument.

     Also, calloc nulls the space that it returns, assuring that the
     memory is all zeros.


 - Function:
     void *realloc ( void *OLD_PNT, unsigned int NEW_SIZE )

     Usage: `new_pnt = (type *)realloc(old_pnt, new_size)'

     The realloc function expands or shrinks the memory allocation in
     `old_pnt' to `new_size' number of bytes.  Realloc copies as much
     of the information from `old_pnt' as it can into the `new_pnt'
     space it returns, up to `new_size' bytes.  If there is a problem
     allocating this memory, 0L will be returned.

     If the `old_pnt' is 0L then realloc will do the equivalent of a
     `malloc(new_size)'.  If `new_size' is 0 and `old_pnt' is not 0L,
     then it will do the equivalent of `free(old_pnt)' and will return
     0L.


 - Function:
     void free ( void *PNT )

     Usage: `free(pnt)'

     The free routine releases allocation in `pnt' which was returned by
     malloc, calloc, or realloc back to the heap.  This allows other
     parts of the program to re-use memory that is not needed anymore.
     It guarantees that the process does not grow too big and swallow a
     large portion of the system resources.


   _WARNING_: there is a quite common myth that all of the space that
is returned by malloc libraries has already been cleared.  _Only_ the
`calloc' routine will zero the memory space it returns.

General Features of the Library
===============================

The debugging features that are available in this debug malloc library
can be divided into a couple basic classifications:

file and line number information
     One of the nice things about a good debugger is its ability to
     provide the file and line number of an offending piece of code.
     This library attempts to give this functionality with the help of
     "cpp", the C preprocessor.  *Note Allocation Macros::.

return-address information
     To debug calls to the library from external sources (i.e. those
     files that could not use the allocation macros), some facilities
     have been provided to supply the caller's address.  This address,
     with the help of a debugger, can help you locate the source of a
     problem.  *Note Return Address::.

fence-post (i.e. bounds) checking
     "Fence-post" memory is the area immediately above or below memory
     allocations.  It is all too easy to write code that accesses above
     or below an allocation - especially when dealing with arrays or
     strings.  The library can write special values in the areas around
     every allocation so it will notice when these areas have been
     overwritten.  *Note Fence-Post Overruns::.

     _NOTE_: The library cannot notice when the program _reads_ from
     these areas, only when it writes values.  Also, fence-post checking
     will increase the amount of memory the program allocates.

heap-constancy verification
     The administration of the library is reasonably complex.  If any
     of the heap-maintenance information is corrupted, the program will
     either crash or give unpredictable results.

     By enabling heap-consistency checking, the library will run
     through its administrative structures to make sure all is in
     order.  This will mean that problems will be caught faster and
     diagnosed better.

     The drawback of this is, of course, that the library often takes
     quite a long time to do this.  It is suitable to enable this only
     during development and debugging sessions.

     _NOTE_: the heap checking routines cannot guarantee that the tests
     will not cause a segmentation-fault if the heap administration
     structures are properly (or improperly if you will) overwritten.
     In other words, the tests will verify that everything is okay but
     may not inform the user of problems in a graceful manner.

logging statistics
     One of the reasons why the debug malloc library was initially
     developed was to track programs' memory usage - specifically to
     locate "memory leaks" which are places where allocated memory is
     never getting freed.  *Note Memory Leaks::.

     The library has a number of logging capabilities that can track
     un-freed memory pointers as well as runtime memory usage, memory
     transactions, administrative actions, and final statistics.

examining freed memory
     Another common problem happens when a program frees a memory
     pointer but goes on to use it again by mistake.  This can lead to
     mysterious crashes and unexplained problems.

     To combat this, the library can write special values into a block
     of memory after it has been freed.  This serves two purposes: it
     will make sure that the program will get garbage data if it trying
     to access the area again, and it will allow the library to verify
     the area later for signs of overwriting.

   If any of the above debugging features detect an error, the library
will try to recover.  If logging is enabled then an error will be
logged with as much information as possible.

   The error messages that the library displays are designed to give the
most information for developers.  If the error message is not
understood, then it is most likely just trying to indicate that a part
of the heap has been corrupted.

   The library can be configured to quit immediately when an error is
detected and to dump a core file or memory-image.  This can be examined
with a debugger to determine the source of the problem.  The library can
either stop after dumping core or continue running.

   _NOTE_: do not be surprised if the library catches problems with
your system's routines.  It took me hours to finally come to the
conclusion that the localtime call, included in SunOS release 4.1,
overwrites one of its fence-post markers.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: How It Works,  Prev: Features,  Up: Overview

How the Library Checks Your Program
===================================

This is one of the newer sections of the library implying that it is
incomplete.  If you have any questions or issues that you'd like to see
handled here, please let me know.

   The dmalloc library replaces the heap library calls normally found in
your system libraries with its own versions.  When you make a call to
malloc (for example), you are calling dmalloc's version of the memory
allocation function.  When you allocate memory with these functions, the
dmalloc library keeps track of a number of pieces of debugging
information about your pointer including: where it was allocated,
exactly how much memory was requested, when the call was made, etc..
This information can then be verified when the pointer is freed or
reallocated and the details can be logged on any errors.

   Whenever you reallocate or free a memory address, the dmalloc library
always performs a number of checks on the pointer to make sure that it
is valid and has not been corrupted.  You can configure the library to
perform additional checks such as detected fence-post writing.  The
library can also be configured to overwrite memory with non-zeros (only
if calloc is not called) when it is allocated and erase the memory when
the pointers are freed.

   In addition to per-pointer checks, you can configure the library to
perform complete heap checks.  These complete checks verify all internal
heap structures and include walking all of the known allocated pointers
to verify each one in turn.  You need this level of checking to find
random pointers in your program which got corrupted but that won't be
freed for a while.  To turn on these checks, you will need to enable the
'check-heap' debug token.  *Note Debug Tokens::.  By default this will
cause the heap to be fully checked each and every time dmalloc is called
whether it is a malloc, free, realloc, or another dmalloc overloaded
function.

   Performing a full heap check can take a good bit of CPU and it may be
that you will want to run it sporadically.  This can be accomplished in
a couple different ways including the '-i' interval argument to the
dmalloc utility.  *Note Dmalloc Program::.  This will cause the check to
be run every N-th time.  For instance, 'dmalloc -i 3' will cause the
heap to be checked before every 3rd call to a memory function.  Values
of 100 or even 1000 for high memory usage programs are more useful than
smaller ones.

   You can also cause the program to start doing detailed heap checking
after a certain point.  For instance, with 'dmalloc -s 1000' option, you
can tell the dmalloc library to enable the heap checks after the 1000th
memory call.  Examine the dmalloc log file produced and use the
iteration count if you have `LOG_ITERATION_COUNT' enabled in your
`settings.h' file.

   The start option can also have the format `file:line'.  For
instance, if it is set to `dmalloc_t.c:126', dmalloc will start
checking the heap after it sees a dmalloc call from the `dmalloc_t.c'
file, line number 126.  If you use `dmalloc_t.c:0', with a 0 line
number, then dmalloc will start checking the heap after it sees a call
from anywhere in the `dmalloc_t.c' file.

File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Allocation Macros,  Next: Return Address,  Prev: Programming,  Up: Programming

Macros Providing File and Line Information
==========================================

By including `dmalloc.h' in your C files, your calls to malloc, calloc,
realloc, recalloc, memalign, valloc, strdup, and free are replaced with
calls to _dmalloc_malloc, _dmalloc_realloc, and _dmalloc_free with
various flags.  Additionally the library replaces calls to xmalloc,
xcalloc, xrealloc, xrecalloc, xmemalign, xvalloc, xstrdup, and xfree
with associated calls.

   These macros use the c-preprocessor `__FILE__' and `__LINE__' macros
which get replaced at compilation time with the current file and
line-number of the source code in question.  The routines use this
information to produce verbose reports on memory problems.

     not freed: '0x38410' (22 bytes) from 'dmalloc_t.c:92'

   This line from a log file shows that memory was not freed from file
`dmalloc_t.c' line 92.  *Note Memory Leaks::.

   You may notice some non standard memory allocation functions in the
above list.  Recalloc is a routine like realloc that reallocates
previously allocated memory to a new size.  If the new memory size is
larger than the old, recalloc initializes the new space to all zeros.
This may or may not be supported natively by your operating system.
Memalign is like malloc but should insure that the returned pointer is
aligned to a certain number of specified bytes.  Currently, the memalign
function is not supported by the library.  It defaults to returning
possibly non-aligned memory for alignment values less than a block-size.
Valloc is like malloc but insures that the returned pointer will be
aligned to a page boundary.  This may or may not be supported natively
by your operating system but is fully supported by the library.  Strdup
is a string duplicating routine which takes in a null terminated string
pointer and returns an allocated copy of the string that will need to be
passed to free later to deallocate.

   The X versions of the standard memory functions (xmalloc, xfree,
etc.)  will print out an error message to standard error and will stop
if the library is unable to allocate any additional memory.  It is
useful to use these routines instead of checking everywhere in your
program for allocation routines returning NULL pointers.

   _WARNING_: If you are including the `dmalloc.h' file in your
sources, it is recommended that it be at the end of your include file
list because dmalloc uses macros and may try to change declarations of
the malloc functions if they come after it.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Return Address,  Next: Argument Checking,  Prev: Allocation Macros,  Up: Programming

Getting Caller Address Information
==================================

Even though the allocation macros can provide file/line information for
some of your code, there are still modules which either you can't
include `dmalloc.h' (such as library routines) or you just don't want
to.  You can still get information about the routines that call dmalloc
function from the return-address information.  To accomplish this, you
must be using this library on one of the supported
architecture/compilers.  *Note Portability::.

   The library attempts to use some assembly hacks to get the
return-address or the address of the line that called the dmalloc
function.  If you have unfreed memory that does not have associated file
and line information, you might see the following non-freed memory
messages.

     not freed: '0x38410' (22 bytes) from 'ra=0xdd2c'
     not freed: '0x38600' (10232 bytes) from 'ra=0x10234d'
     not freed: '0x38220' (137 bytes) from 'ra=0x82cc'

   With the help of a debugger, these return-addresses (or ra) can then
be identified.  I've provided a `ra_info.pl' perl script in the
`contrib/' directory with the dmalloc sources which seems to work well
with gdb.  You can also use manual methods for gdb to find the
return-address location.  *Note Translate Return Addresses::.

Checking of Function Arguments
==============================

One potential problem with the library and its multitude of checks and
diagnoses is that they only get performed when a dmalloc function is
called.  One solution this is to include `dmalloc.h' and compile your
source code with the `DMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK' flag defined and enable the
`check-funcs' token.  *Note Debug Tokens::.

     cc -DDMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK file.c

   _NOTE_: Once you have compiled your source with DMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK
enabled, you will have to recompile with it off to disconnect the
library.  *Note Disabling the Library::.

   _WARNING_: You should be sure to have `dmalloc.h' included at the
end of your include file list because dmalloc uses macros and may try
to change declarations of the checked functions if they come after it.

   When this is defined dmalloc will override a number of functions and
will insert a routine which knows how to check its own arguments and
then call the real function.  Dmalloc can check such functions as
`bcopy', `index', `strcat', and `strcasecmp'.  For the full list see
the end of `dmalloc.h'.

   When you call `strlen', for instance, dmalloc will make sure the
string argument's fence-post areas have not been overwritten, its file
and line number locations are good, etc.  With `bcopy', dmalloc will
make sure that the destination string has enough space to store the
number of bytes specified.

   For all of the arguments checked, if the pointer is not in the heap
then it is ignored since dmalloc does not know anything about it.

Additional Non-standard Routines
================================

The library has a number of variables that are not a standard part of
most malloc libraries:

`int dmalloc_errno'
     This variable stores the internal dmalloc library error number
     like errno does for the system calls.  It can be passed to
     `dmalloc_strerror()' (see below) to get a string version of the
     error.  It will have a value of zero if the library has not
     detected any problems.

`char * dmalloc_logpath'
     This variable can be used to set the dmalloc log filename.  The env
     variable DMALLOC_LOGFILE overrides this variable.


   Additionally the library provides a number of non-standard malloc
routines:

 - Function:
     void dmalloc_shutdown ( void )

     This function shuts the library down and logs the final statistics
     and information especially the non-freed memory pointers.  The
     library has code to support auto-shutdown if your system has the
     `on_exit()' call, `atexit()' call, or compiler destructor support
     (see `conf.h').  If you do not have these, then `dmalloc_shutdown'
     should be called right before `exit()' or as the last function in
     `main()'.

          main()
          {
                  ...
                  dmalloc_shutdown();
                  exit(0);
          }

 - Function:
     int dmalloc_verify ( char * PNT )

     This function verifies individual memory pointers that are suspect
     of memory problems.  To check the entire heap pass in a NULL or 0
     pointer.  The routine returns DMALLOC_VERIFY_ERROR or
     DMALLOC_VERIFY_NOERROR.

     _NOTE_: `dmalloc_verify()' can only check the heap with the
     functions that have been enabled.  For example, if fence-post
     checking is not enabled, `dmalloc_verify()' cannot check the
     fence-post areas in the heap.

 - Function:
     unsigned int dmalloc_debug ( const unsigned int FLAGS )

     This routine sets the debug functionality flags and returns the
     previous flag value.  It is helpful in server or cgi-bin programs
     where environmental variables cannot be used.  *Note Debugging A
     Server::.  For instance, if debugging should never be enabled for a
     program, a call to `dmalloc_debug(0)' as the first call in
     `main()' will disable all the memory debugging from that point on.

     _NOTE_: you cannot add or remove certain flags such as signal
     handlers since they are setup at initialization time only.

     _NOTE_: you can also use `dmalloc_debug_setup' below.


 - Function:
     unsigned int dmalloc_debug_current ( void )

     This routine returns the current debug functionality value value.
     This allows you to save a copy of the debug dmalloc settings to be
     changed and then restored later.


 - Function:
     void dmalloc_debug_setup ( const char * OPTIONS_STR )

     This routine sets the global debugging functionality as an option
     string.  Normally this would be passed in in the DMALLOC_OPTIONS
     environmental variable.  This is here to override the env or for
     circumstances where modifying the environment is not possible or
     does not apply such as servers or cgi-bin programs.  *Note
     Debugging A Server::.

     Some examples:

          /* debug tokens high, threaded lock-on at 20, log to dmalloc.%p (pid) */
          dmalloc_debug_setup("debug=0x4f46d03,lockon=20,log=dmalloc.%p");
          
          /* turn on some debug tokens directly and log to the file 'logfile' */
          dmalloc_debug_setup("log-stats,log-non-free,check-fence,log=logfile");


 - Function:
     int dmalloc_examine ( const DMALLOC_PNT PNT, DMALLOC_SIZE *
     USER_SIZE_P, DMALLOC_SIZE * TOTAL_SIZE_P, char ** FILE_P, int *
     LINE_P, DMALLOC_PNT * RET_ADDR_P, unsigned long * USER_MARK_P,
     unsigned long * SEEN_P )

     This function returns the size of a pointer's allocation as well
     as the total size given including administrative overhead, file
     and line or the return-address from where it was allocated, the
     last pointer when the pointer was "used", and the number of times
     the pointer has been "seen".  It will return DMALLOC_NOERROR or
     DMALLOC_ERROR depending on whether pnt is good or not.

     _NOTE_: This function is _certainly_ not provided by most if not
     all other malloc libraries.


 - Function:
     void dmalloc_track ( const dmalloc_track_t TRACK_FUNC )

     Register an allocation tracking function which will be called each
     time an allocation occurs.  Pass in NULL to disable.  To take a
     look at what information is provided, see the dmalloc_track_t
     function typedef in dmalloc.h.


 - Function:
     unsigned unsigned long dmalloc_mark ( void )

     Return to the caller the current "mark" which can be used later to
     log the pointers which have changed since this mark with the
     `dmalloc_log_changed' function.  Multiple marks can be saved and
     used.

     This is very useful when using the library with a server which does
     not exit.  You can then save a mark before a transaction or event
     happens and then check to see what has changed using the
     `dmalloc_log_changed' function below.  *Note Debugging A Server::.

     If you `LOG_ITERATION' enabled in your `settings.h' file then the
     entries in the log file will be prepended with the number of memory
     transactions that the library has handled so far.  You can also
     enable `LOG_PNT_ITERATION' in `settings.h' to store the memory
     transaction number with each pointer.


 - Function:
     unsigned unsigned long dmalloc_memory_allocated ( void )

     Return to the caller the total number of bytes that have been
     allocated by the library.  This is not the current in use but the
     total number of bytes returned by allocation functions.


 - Function:
     unsigned unsigned int dmalloc_page_size ( void )

     Return to the caller the memory page-size being used by the
     library.  This should be the same value as the one returned by the
     `getpagesize()' function, if available.


 - Function:
     unsigned unsigned long dmalloc_count_changed ( const unsigned long
     MARK, const int NOT_FREED_B, const int FREE_B )

     Count the pointers that have changed since the mark which was
     returned by `dmalloc_mark'.  If `not_freed_b' is set to non-0 then
     count the pointers that have not been freed.  If `free_b' is set
     to non-0 then count the pointers that have been freed.

     This can be used in conjunction with the `dmalloc_mark()' function
     to help servers which never exit ensure that transactions or
     events are not leaking memory.  *Note Debugging A Server::.

          unsigned long mark = dmalloc_mark() ;
          ...
          assert(dmalloc_count_changed(mark, 1, 0) == 0) ;


 - Function:
     void dmalloc_log_stats ( void )

     This routine outputs the current dmalloc statistics to the log
     file.

 - Function:
     void dmalloc_log_unfreed( void )

     This function logs the unfreed-memory information to the log file.
     This is also useful to log the currently allocated points to the
     log file to be compared against another dump later on.


 - Function:
     void dmalloc_log_changed ( const unsigned long MARK, const int
     NOT_FREED_B, const int FREED_B, const int DETAILS_B )

     Log the pointers that have changed since the mark which was
     returned by `dmalloc_mark'.  If `not_freed_b' is set to non-0 then
     log the pointers that have not been freed.  If `free_b' is set to
     non-0 then log the pointers that have been freed.  If `details_b'
     set to non-0 then log the individual pointers that have changed
     otherwise just log the summaries.

     This can be used in conjunction with the `dmalloc_mark()' function
     to help servers which never exit find transactions or events which
     are leaking memory.  *Note Debugging A Server::.


 - Function:
     void dmalloc_vmessage ( const char * FORMAT, va_list ARGS )

     Write a message into the dmalloc logfile using vprintf-like
     arguments.


 - Function:
     void dmalloc_message ( const char * FORMAT, ... )

     Write a message into the dmalloc logfile using printf-like
     arguments.


 - Function:
     const char * dmalloc_strerror ( const int ERROR_NUMBER )

     This function returns the string representation of the error value
     in `error_number' (which probably should be dmalloc_errno).  This
     allows the logging of more verbose memory error messages.

     You can also display the string representation of an error value
     by a call to the `dmalloc' program with a `-e #' option.  *Note
     Dmalloc Program::.

Description of the Internal Error Codes
=======================================

The following error codes are defined in `error_val.h'.  They are used
by the library to indicate a detected problem.  They can be caused by
the user (`ERROR_TOO_BIG') or can indicate an internal library problem
(`ERROR_SLOT_CORRUPT').  The `dmalloc' utility can give you the string
version of the error with the `-e' argument:

     $ dmalloc -e 60
     dmalloc: dmalloc_errno value '60' =
        'pointer is not on block boundary'

   Here are the error codes set by the library.  They are non
contiguous on purpose because I add and delete codes all of the time
and there are sections for various error-code types.

`1 (ERROR_NONE)'
     No error.  It is good coding practice to set the no-error code to
     be non-0 value because it forces you to set it explicitly.

`2 (INVALID_ERROR)'
     Invalid error number.  If the library outputs this error however
     the dmalloc utility says that it is invalid then your dmalloc
     utility may be out of date with the library you linked against.
     This will be returned with all error codes not listed here.

`10 (ERROR_BAD_SETUP)'
     Bad setup value.  This is currently unused but it is intended to
     report on invalid setup configuration information.

`11 (ERROR_IN_TWICE)'
     Library went recursive.  This usually indicates that you are not
     using the threaded version of the library.  Or if you are then you
     are not using the `-o' "lock-on" option.  *Note Using With
     Threads::.

`13 (ERROR_LOCK_NOT_CONFIG)'
     Thread locking has not been configured.  This indicates that you
     attempted to use the `-o' "lock-on" option without linking with the
     thread version of the library.

`20 (ERROR_IS_NULL)'
     Pointer is null.  The program passed a NULL (0L) pointer to `free'
     and you have the `error-free-null' token enabled.

`21 (ERROR_NOT_IN_HEAP)'
     Pointer is not pointing to heap data space.  This means that the
     program passed an out-of-bounds pointer to `free' or `realloc'.
     This could be someone trying to work with a wild pointer or trying
     to free a pointer from a different source than `malloc'.

`22 (ERROR_NOT_FOUND)'
     Cannot locate pointer in heap.  The user passed in a pointer which
     the heap did not know about.  Either this pointer was allocated by
     some other mechanism (like `mmap' or `sbrk' directly) or it is a
     random invalid pointer.

     In some rare circumstances, sometimes seen with shared libraries,
     there can be two separate copies of the dmalloc library in a
     program.  Each one does not know about the pointers allocated by
     the other.

`23 (ERROR_IS_FOUND)'
     This indicates that the pointer specified in the address part of
     the environmental variable was discovered by the library.  *Note
     Environment Variable::.  This error is useful so you can put a
     breakpoint in a debugger to find where a particular address was
     allocated.  *Note Using With a Debugger::.

`24 (ERROR_BAD_FILE)'
     A possibly invalid filename was discovered in the dmalloc
     administrative sections.  This could indicate some corruption of
     the internal tables.  It also could mean that you have a source
     file whose name is longer than 100 characters.  See
     `MAX_FILE_LENGTH' in the `settings.dist' file.

`25 (ERROR_BAD_LINE)'
     A line-number was out-of-bounds in the dmalloc administrative
     sections.  This could indicate some corruption of the internal
     tables.  It also could mean that you have a source file containing
     more than `30000' lines of code.  See `MAX_LINE_NUMBER' in the
     `settings.dist' file.

`26 (ERROR_UNDER_FENCE)'
     This indicates that a pointer had its lower bound picket-fence
     magic number overwritten.  If the `check-fence' token is enabled,
     the library writes magic values above and below allocations to
     protect against overflow.  Most likely this is because a pointer
     below it went past its allocate and wrote into the next pointer's
     space.

`27 (ERROR_OVER_FENCE)'
     This indicates that a pointer had its upper bound picket-fence
     magic space overwritten.  If the `check-fence' token is enabled,
     the library writes magic values above and below allocations to
     protect against overflow.  Most likely this is because an array or
     string allocation wrote past the end of the allocation.

     Check for improper usage of `strcat', `sprintf', `strcpy', and any
     other functions which work with strings and do not protect
     themselves by tracking the size of the string.  These functions
     should _always_ be replaced with: `strncat', `snprintf',
     `strncpy', and others.

`28 (ERROR_WOULD_OVERWRITE)'
     This error is generated by the function pointer checking code
     usually enabled wit the `check-funcs' token.  Dmalloc overloads a
     number of string and memory copying functions and verifies that
     the buffers (if allocated in the heap) would not be overwritten by
     the function.

`30 (ERROR_NOT_START_BLOCK)'
     This indicates that the user passed in a pointer to be freed or
     reallocated that was not at the start of the allocation.  You
     would get this error, for example, if you allocate and get pointer
     `X' but then try to free `X+1'.

`40 (ERROR_BAD_SIZE)'
     This error indicates that a size value in the internal structures
     of the library were corrupted.  This could be a random pointer
     problem, pointer overflow, or some other corruption.

`41 (ERROR_TOO_BIG)'
     An allocation asked for memory larger than the configured maximum.
     This is a user configured setting.  See `LARGEST_ALLOCATION' in
     the `settings.dist' file.  It is used to protect against wild
     allocation sizes.  If you have super large allocation sizes then
     you should tune the `LARGEST_ALLOCATION' value appropriately.

`43 (ERROR_ALLOC_FAILED)'
     The library could not allocate more heap space and the program has
     run out of memory.  This could indicate that you've overflowed
     some system imposed limit.  On many operation systems, the
     `ulimit' call can tune system defaults.

`44 (ERROR_ALLOC_NONLINEAR)'
     If the `force-linear' token is enabled, the library will ensure
     that the heap memory returned, is linear and contiguous.  This
     should only be used in special circumstances.

`45 (ERROR_OVER_LIMIT)'
     The library has allocated more memory than was specified in the
     memory-limit environmental variable.  *Note Environment Variable::.

`60 (ERROR_NOT_ON_BLOCK)'
     The user tried to free or realloc a pointer that was not pointing
     to a block boundary.  You would get this error, for example, if
     you allocate and get pointer `X' but then try to free `X+1'.

`61 (ERROR_ALREADY_FREE)'
     The user tried to free a pointer than has already been freed.
     This is a very common mistake and can lead to serious problems.
     It can be because a destructor is being called twice for some
     reason.  Although tracking down the specific source is highly
     recommended, it is good to set pointers to NULL (0L) after you
     free them as a rule.

`67 (ERROR_FREE_OVERWRITTEN)'
     If either the `free-blank' or `check-blank' tokens are enabled
     then the library will overwrite memory when it is freed with the
     "dmalloc-free" byte (hex 0xdf, octal 0337, decimal 223).  If the
     program writes into this space, then the library will detect the
     write and trigger this error.  This could indicate that the
     program is using a pointer after it has been freed.

`70 (ERROR_ADMIN_LIST)'
     An internal corruption in the library's administrative structures
     has been detected.  This could be a random pointer problem, pointer
     overflow, or some other corruption.

`72 (ERROR_ADDRESS_LIST)'
     An internal corruption in the library's administrative structures
     has been detected.  This could be a random pointer problem, pointer
     overflow, or some other corruption.

`73 (ERROR_SLOT_CORRUPT)'
     An internal corruption in the library's administrative structures
     has been detected.  This could be a random pointer problem, pointer
     overflow, or some other corruption.

How to Disable the library
==========================

When you are finished with the development and debugging sessions, you
may want to disable the dmalloc library and put in its place either the
system's memory-allocation routines, gnu-malloc, or maybe your own.
Attempts have been made to make this a reasonably painless process.  The
ease of the extraction depends heavily on how many of the library's
features your made use of during your coding.

   Reasonable suggestions are welcome as to how to improve this process
while maintaining the effectiveness of the debugging.

   * If you want to _totally_ disable the dmalloc library then you will
     need to recompile all the C files that include `dmalloc.h' while
     defining `DMALLOC_DISABLE'.  This will cause the dmalloc macros to
     not be applied.  *Note Allocation Macros::.

          cc -g -DDMALLOC_DISABLE main.c

     An alternative is to surround the `dmalloc.h' inclusion or any
     direct dmalloc references with an `#ifdef DMALLOC' and then just
     remove the -DDMALLOC.

          #ifdef DMALLOC
          #include "dmalloc.h"
          #endif
          
          main()
          {
            ...
          
          #ifdef DMALLOC
            dmalloc_verify(0L);
          #endif
            return 0;
          }

          // to get dmalloc information
          $ cc -Ddmalloc main.c
          
          // without dmalloc information
          $ cc main.c

   * If you compiled any of your source modules with
     `DMALLOC_FUNC_CHECK' defined then you must first recompile all
     those modules without the flag enabled.

     If you have disabled dmalloc with the `DMALLOC_DISABLED' flag or
     never included `dmalloc.h' in any of your C files, then you will
     not need to recompile your sources when you need to disable the
     library.

     If you get unresolved references like `_dmalloc_malloc' or
     `_dmalloc_bcopy' then something was not disabled as it should have
     been.

Using the Library with C++
==========================

For those people using the C++ language, the library tries to configure
and build `libdmallocxx.a' library.  This library should be linked into
your C++ programs instead of `libdmalloc.a'.

   Dmalloc is not as good with C++ as C because the dynamic memory
routines in C++ are `new()' and `delete()' as opposed to `malloc()' and
`free()'.  Since new and delete are usually not used as functions but
rather as `x = new type', there is no easy way for dmalloc to pass in
file and line information unfortunately.  The `libdmallocxx.a' library
provides the file `dmallocc.cc' which effectively redirects `new' to
the more familiar `malloc' and `delete' to the more familiar `free'.

   _NOTE_: The author is not a C++ hacker so feedback in the form of
other hints and ideas for C++ users would be much appreciated.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Using With a Debugger,  Next: Using With Threads,  Prev: Using With C++,  Up: Programming

Using Dmalloc With a Debugger
=============================

Here are a number of possible scenarios for using the dmalloc library to
track down problems with your program.

   You should first enable a logfile filename and turn on a set of debug
features.  You can use `dmalloc -l logfile low' to accomplish this.  If
you are interested in having the error messages printed to your
terminal as well, enable the `print-messages' token by typing `dmalloc
-p print-messages' afterwards.  *Note Dmalloc Program::.

   Now you can enter your debugger (I use the _excellent_ GNU debugger
gdb), and put a break-point in `dmalloc_error()' which is the internal
error routine for the library.  When your program is run, it will stop
there if a memory problem is detected.

   If you are using GDB, I would recommend adding the contents of
`dmalloc.gdb' in the `contrib' subdirectory to your `.gdbinit' file in
your home directory.  This enables the `dmalloc' command which will
prompt you for the arguments to the dmalloc command and will set a
break point in `dmalloc_error()' automatically.

   If you are using shared libraries, you may want to execute the
following commands initially to load in dmalloc and other library
symbols:

     (gdb) sharedlibrary
     (gdb) add-shared-symbol-files

* Menu:

* General Errors::                Diagnosing general problems with a debugger.
* Memory Leaks::                  Tracking down non-freed memory.
* Fence-Post Overruns::           Diagnosing fence-post overwritten memory.
* Translate Return Addresses::    Convert ra return-addresses into a location.

Diagnosing General Problems with a Debugger
-------------------------------------------

If your program stops at the `dmalloc_error()' routine then one of a
number of problems could be happening.  Incorrect arguments could have
been passed to a malloc call: asking for negative number of bytes,
trying to realloc a non-heap pointer, etc..  There also could be a
problem with the system's allocations: you've run out of memory, some
other function in your program is using the heap allocation functions
`mmap' or `sbrk', etc..  However, it is most likely that some code that
has been executed was naughty.

   To get more information about the problem, first print via the
debugger the dmalloc_errno variable to get the library's internal error
code.  You can suspend your debugger and run `dmalloc -e
value-returned-from-print' to get an English translation of the error.
A number of the error messages are designed to indicate specific
problems with the library administrative structures and may not be
user-friendly.

   If the problem was due to the arguments or system allocations then
the source of the problem has been found.  However, if some code did
something wrong, you may have some more work to do to locate the actual
problem.  The `check-heap' token should be enabled and the interval
setting disabled or set to a low value so that the library can find the
problem as close as possible to its source.  The code that was execute
right before the library halted, can then be examined closely for
irregularities.  *Note Debug Tokens::, *Note Dmalloc Program::.

   You may also want to put calls to `dmalloc_verify(0)' in your code
before the section which generated the error.  This should locate the
problem faster by checking the library's structures at that point.

Tracking Down Non-Freed Memory
------------------------------

So you've run your program, examined the log-file and discovered (to
your horror) some un-freed memory.  Memory leaks can become large
problems since even the smallest and most insignificant leak can starve
the program given the right circumstances.

     not freed: '0x45008' (12 bytes) from 'ra=0x1f8f4'
     not freed: '0x45028' (12 bytes) from 'unknown'
     not freed: '0x45048' (10 bytes) from 'argv.c:1077'
       known memory not freed: 1 pointer, 10 bytes
     unknown memory not freed: 2 pointers, 24 bytes

   Above you will see a sample of some non-freed memory messages from
the logfile.  In the first line the `0x45008' is the pointer that was
not freed, the `12 bytes' is the size of the unfreed block, and the
`ra=0x1f8f4' or return-address shows where the allocation originated
from.  *Note Translate Return Addresses::.

   The systems which cannot provide return-address information show
`unknown' instead, as in the 2nd line in the sample above.

   The `argv.c:1077' information from the 3rd line shows the file and
line number which allocated the memory which was not freed.  This
information comes from the calls from C files which included
`dmalloc.h'.  *Note Allocation Macros::.

   At the bottom of the sample it totals the memory for you and breaks
it down to known memory (those calls which supplied the file/line
information) and unknown (the rest).

   Often, you may allocate memory in via `strdup()' or another routine,
so the logfile listing where in the `strdup' routine the memory was
allocated does not help locate the true source of the memory leak - the
routine that called `strdup'.  Without a mechanism to trace the calling
stack, there is no way for the library to see who the caller of the
caller (so to speak) was.

   However, there is a way to track down unfreed memory in this
circumstance.  You need to compile the library with `STORE_SEEN_COUNT'
defined in `conf.h'.  The library will then record how many times a
pointer has been allocated or freed.  It will display the unfreed
memory as:

     not freed: '0x45008|s3' (12 bytes) from 'ra=0x1f8f4'

   The `STORE_SEEN_COUNT' option adds a `|s#' qualifier to the address.
This means that the address in question was seen `#' many times.  In
the above example, the address `0x45008' was seen `3' times.  The last
time it was allocated, it was not freed.

   How can a pointer be "seen" 3 times?  Let say you `strdup' a string
of 12 characters and get address `0x45008' - this is #1 time the
pointer is seen.  You then free the pointer (seen #2) but later
`strdup' another 12 character string and it gets the `0x45008' address
from the free list (seen #3).

   So to find out who is allocating this particular 12 bytes the 3rd
time, try `dmalloc -a 0x45008:3'.  The library will stop the program the
third time it sees the `0x45008' address.  You then enter a debugger
and put a break point at `dmalloc_error'.  Run the program and when the
breakpoint is reached you can examine the stack frame to determine who
called `strdup' to allocate the pointer.

   To not bother with the `STORE_SEEN_COUNT' feature, you can also run
your program with the `never-reuse' token enabled.  This token will
cause the library to never reuse memory that has been freed.  Unique
addresses are always generated.  This should be used with caution since
it may cause your program to run out of memory.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Fence-Post Overruns,  Next: Translate Return Addresses,  Prev: Memory Leaks,  Up: Using With a Debugger

Diagnosing Fence-Post Overwritten Memory
----------------------------------------

For a definition of fence-posts please see the "Features" section.
*Note Features::.

   To detect fence-post overruns, you need to enable the `check-fence'
token.  *Note Debug Tokens::.  This pads your allocations with some
extra bytes at the front and the end and watches the space to make sure
that they don't get overwritten.  _NOTE:_ The library cannot detect if
this space gets read, only written.

   If you have encountered a fence-post memory error, the logfile
should be able to tell you the offending address.

     free: failed UNDER picket-fence magic-number checking:
     pointer '0x1d008' from 'dmalloc_t.c:427'
     Dump of proper fence-bottom bytes: '\e\253\300\300\e\253\300\300'
     Dump of '0x1d008'-8: '\e\253\300\300WOW!\003\001pforger\023\001\123'

   The above sample shows that the pointer `0x1d008' has had its lower
fence-post area overwritten.  This means that the code wrote below the
bottom of the address or above the address right below this one.  In the
sample, the string that did it was `WOW!'.

   The library first shows you what the proper fence-post information
should look like, and then shows what the pointer's bad information was.
If it cannot print the character, it will display the value as `\ddd'
where ddd are three octal digits.

   By enabling the `check-heap' debugging token and assigning the
interval setting to a low number, you should be able to locate
approximately when this problem happened.  *Note Debug Tokens::, *Note
Dmalloc Program::.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Translate Return Addresses,  Prev: Fence-Post Overruns,  Up: Using With a Debugger

Translating Return Addresses into Code Locations
------------------------------------------------

The following gdb commands help you translate the return-addresses (ra=)
entries in the logfile into locations in your code.  I've provided a
`ra_info.pl' perl script in the `contrib/' directory with the dmalloc
sources which seems to work well with gdb.  But, if you need to do it
manually, here are the commands in gdb to use.

     # you may need to add the following commands to load in shared libraries
     (gdb) sharedlibrary
     (gdb) add-shared-symbol-files
     
     (gdb) x 0x10234d
     0x10234d <_findbuf+132>: 0x7fffceb7
     
     (gdb) info line *(0x82cc)
     Line 1092 of argv.c starts at pc 0x7540 and ends at 0x7550.

   In the above example, gdb was used to find that the two non-freed
memory pointers were allocated in `_findbuf()' and in file argv.c line
1092 respectively.  The `x address' (for examine) can always be used on
the return-addresses but the `info line *(address)' will only work if
that file was compiled using the `-g' option and has not been stripped.
This limitation may not be true in later versions of gdb.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Using With Threads,  Next: Using With Cygwin,  Prev: Using With a Debugger,  Up: Programming

Using the Library with a Thread Package
=======================================

Threads are special operating system facilities which allow your
programs to have multiple threads of execution (hence the name).  In
effect your program can be doing a number of things "at the same time".
This allows you to take full advantage of modern operating system
scheduling and multi-processor hardware.  If I've already lost you or
if any of the terminology below does not make sense, see manuals about
POSIX threads (pthreads) before going any further.  O'Reilly publishes
a pretty good pthreads manual for example.

   To use dmalloc with your threaded program, you will first need to
make sure that you are linking with `libdmallocth.a' which is the
threaded version of the library.  The support for threads in dmalloc
should be adequate for most if not all testing scenarios.  It provides
support for mutex locking itself to protect against race conditions that
result in multiple simultaneous execution.  One of the major problems is
that most thread libraries uses malloc themselves.  Since all of
dmalloc's initialization happens when a call to malloc is made, we may
be attempting to initialize or lock the mutex while the thread library
is booting up.  A very bad thing since thread libraries don't expect to
recurse.

   The solution to this problem is to have the library not initialize or
lock its mutex variable until after a certain number of allocation calls
have been completed.  If the library does not wait before initializing
the locks, the thread library will probably core dump.  If it waits too
long then it can't protect itself from multiple execution and it will
abort or other bad things might happen.  You adjust the number of times
to wait at runtime with the `lock-on' option to the dmalloc program
(for example `dmalloc -o 20').  *Note Dmalloc Program::.  Times values
between 5 and 30 are probably good although operating systems will vary
significantly.  You know its too low if your program immediately core
dumps and too high if the dmalloc library says its gone recursive
although with low values, you might get either problem.

   An additional complexity is when we are initializing the lock before
mutex locking around the library.  As mentioned, the initialization
itself may generate a malloc call causing the library to go recursive
and the pthread library to possibly core dump. With the THREAD_INIT_LOCK
setting defined in `settings.h', you can tune how many times before we
start locking to try and initialize the mutex lock.  It defaults to 2
which seems to work for me.  If people need to have this runtime
configurable or would like to present an alternative default, please let
me know.

   So to use dmalloc with a threaded program, follow the following steps
carefully.

  1. Follow the installation instructions on how to configure, make,
     and install the library but make sure to add the
     `--enable-threads' argument to configure.  *Note Installation::.

  2. Typing `make' should be enough to build the threaded versions of
     the libraries including `libdmallocth.a'.

  3. Link the dmalloc threaded library into your program.  The dmalloc
     library should probably be placed at or near the end of the library
     list.

  4. Enable the debugging options that you need by typing `dmalloc -l
     logfile -i 100 low' (for example).  `dmalloc --usage' will provide
     verbose usage info for the dmalloc program.  *Note Dmalloc
     Program::.

  5. Enable the "lock-on" option (for example `dmalloc -o 20').  As
     explained above, you may have to try different values before
     getting it right.  Values between 5 and 30 are probably good.

  6. If you get a dmalloc error #13 `thread locking has not been
     configured' then you have not compiled you program with the
     threaded version of dmalloc or there was a problem building it.

  7. If everything works, you should be able to run your program, have
     it not immediately crash, and the dmalloc library should not
     complain about recursion.

programmers only please.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Using With Cygwin,  Next: Debugging A Server,  Prev: Using With Threads,  Up: Programming

Using the library with Cygwin environment.
==========================================

The Cygwin environment is a Linux-like environment for Windows.  It
provides Linux look and feel as well as a programming environment.  See
URL `http://www.cygwin.com/' for more details.

   The challenge with using dmalloc to debug Cygwin programs is that
when it initializes, dmalloc makes a call to `getenv' to read the
environmental variables.  It is looking for the value of the
`DMALLOC_OPTIONS' variable which sets the debugging options.  *Note
Environment Variable::.  Because Cygwin calls a memory allocation
function while it is loading its shared libraries, it goes recursive
when `getenv' is called from within `malloc' causing a segfault.

   To work around this, I have added to the configure script a check to
make sure that calls to `getenv' are okay inside of malloc.  See
`GETENV_SAFE' in `conf.h'.  If they are not then you are going to have
to add some code into the `main' function in your program to initialize
the dmalloc flags yourself.  Here is a code sample:

     main(int argc, char **argv)
     {
     #ifdef DMALLOC
       /*
        * Get environ variable DMALLOC_OPTIONS and pass the settings string
        * on to dmalloc_debug_setup to setup the dmalloc debugging flags.
        */
       dmalloc_debug_setup(getenv("DMALLOC_OPTIONS"));
     #endif
     
       /* rest of code in main starts here */
       ...
     }

   The `#ifdef' is just a good idea.  I means that when debugging with
dmalloc you need to compile your code with `-DDMALLOC'.  When you are
done debugging you can remove the flag and the call to
`dmalloc_debug_setup' will be removed.

   Please let me know if there is a different way to read the
environment in Cygwin without calling `getenv' or if there is a better
way to do this.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Debugging A Server,  Prev: Using With Cygwin,  Up: Programming

Debugging Memory in a Server or Cgi-Bin Process
===============================================

There are some specified challenges when trying to debug allocations in
processes which do not startup, run, and then shutdown.  Server
processes (often called daemons) are those that are started (often at
system boot time) and run perpetually.  Other processes which are
difficult to debug are CGI programs which are spawned by web servers or
when you want to start debugging inside of a child process.

  1. Build your server or cgi-bin program with the dmalloc library like
     any other program.  *Note Getting Started::.

  2. Add code into your program to enable the library flags to perform
     the memory checks that you require.  Since these programs often do
     not run from the command line, you cannot use the dmalloc utility
     program and modify the process environment.  *Note Dmalloc
     Program::.  The library provides a couple of functions to set the
     debugging flags when a program is running.

  3. To set the memory debugging flags, use the `dmalloc_debug_setup'
     function which takes a string in the same format of the
     `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' environmental variable.  *Note Environment
     Variable::.  Use the dmalloc utility with the `-n' no-changes
     argument to see the appropriate settings for the `DMALLOC_OPTIONS'
     environmental variable.

          > dmalloc -n -l logfile high
          Outputed:
          DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x4f4ed03,log=logfile
          export DMALLOC_OPTIONS

     So if you want to turn on `high' debugging and log to the file
     `logfile' then you would copy the above `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' value
     into a call to `dmalloc_debug_setup'.  Notice that I have
     surrounded the dmalloc code with an `#ifdef DMALLOC' so you'll
     have to compile using the `-DDMALLOC' flag.

          main()
          {
          #ifdef DMALLOC
            /* set the 'high' flags */
            dmalloc_debug_setup("debug=0x4f47d03,log=logfile");
          #endif
            ...
          }

     _Please note_ that the `dmalloc_debug_setup' function does not
     know about `high', `low', or other debug tokens but needs the
     actual flag values.

  4. For earlier versions of the library (before 5.0.0) without
     `dmalloc_debug_setup', the `dmalloc_debug' function is available
     to set the flags directly, but it cannot adjust the logfile name
     and the other environment settings.  You can use the dmalloc
     utility program to see what the numerical equivalent of the `high'
     token.

          > dmalloc -n high
          Outputed:
          DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x4f4ed03
          export DMALLOC_OPTIONS

     You can then take the `0x4f4ed03' hexadecimal number and call
     `dmalloc_debug' with that number.

          main()
          {
          #ifdef DMALLOC
            /* set the 'high' flags */
            dmalloc_debug(0x4f4ed03);
          #endif
            ...
          }

  5. Even with the settings enabled, you may have problems getting the
     logfile to be written if your program is running as `nobody' or
     another user without permissions for security reasons.  This is
     especially true for cgi-bin programs.  In this case you should
     specify a full path to your malloc logfile in a world writable
     directory (ex.
     `dmalloc_debug_setup("debug=0x4f47d03,log=/var/tmp/malloc");').
     Watch for programs which change into other directories and which
     may cause logfiles specified as relative or local paths to be
     dropped in other locations.  You may always want to use a full
     path logfile.

  6. Once you have your settings enabled and your log is being
     generated, you may now want to check out how your process is doing
     in terms of unfreed memory.  Since it is not shutting down, the
     automatic unfreed log entries are not being dropped to the
     logfile.  By using the `dmalloc_mark' and `dmalloc_log_changed'
     functions, you can set a mark point at a certain place inside of
     your program, and then later see whether there are any unfreed
     pointers since the mark.

          main()
          {
          #ifdef DMALLOC
            /* set the 'high' flags */
            dmalloc_debug_setup("debug=0x4f47d03,log=logfile");
          #endif
          
            while (1) {
              /* accept a connection from a client */
              accept_connection();
          
              while (1) {
          #ifdef DMALLOC
                unsigned long mark;
                /* get the current dmalloc position */
                mark = dmalloc_mark() ;
          #endif
                /* process the connection */
                if (process_connection() != PROCESS_OK) {
                  break;
                }
          #ifdef DMALLOC
                /* log unfreed pointers that have been added to the heap since mark */
                dmalloc_log_changed(mark,
                                    1 /* log unfreed pointers */,
                                    0 /* do not log freed pointers */,
                                    1 /* log individual pointers otherwise a summary */);
          #endif
              }
              /* close the connection with the client */
              close_connection();
            }
            ...
          }

     Usually you would set the mark after the initializations and before
     each transaction is processed.  Then for each transaction you can
     use `dmalloc_log_changed' to show the unfreed memory.  *Note
     Extensions::.

  7. You can also use the `dmalloc_log_stats' function to dump general
     information about the heap.  Also, remember that you can use the
     `dmalloc_message' and `dmalloc_vmessage' routines to annotate the
     dmalloc logfile with details to help you debug memory problems.
     *Note Extensions::.

It is designed to print the shell commands necessary to make the
appropriate changes to the environment.  Unfortunately, it cannot make
the changes on its own so the output from dmalloc should be sent
through the `eval' shell command which will do the commands.

File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Shell Alias,  Next: Utility Usage,  Prev: Dmalloc Program,  Up: Dmalloc Program

Using a Shell Alias with the Utility
====================================

The dmalloc program is designed to assist in the setting of the
environment variable `DMALLOC_OPTIONS'.  *Note Environment Variable::.
It is designed to print the shell commands necessary to make the
appropriate changes to the environment.  Unfortunately, it cannot make
the changes on its own so the output from dmalloc should be sent
through the `eval' shell command which will do the commands.

   With shells that have aliasing or macro capabilities: csh, bash, ksh,
tcsh, zsh, etc., setting up an alias to dmalloc to do the eval call is
recommended.  Bash, ksh, and zsh users should add the following to their
`.bashrc', `.profile', or `.zshrc' file respectively (notice the `-b'
option for bourne shell output):

     function dmalloc { eval `command dmalloc -b $*`; }

   If your shell does not support the `command' function then try:

     function dmalloc { eval `\dmalloc -b $*`; }
   or
     function dmalloc { eval `/usr/local/bin/dmalloc -b $*`; }

   If you are _still_ using csh or tcsh, you should add the following
to your `.cshrc' file (notice the `-C' option for c-shell output):

     alias dmalloc 'eval `\dmalloc -C \!*`'

   This allows the user to execute the dmalloc command as `dmalloc
arguments'.

   Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as /bin/sh) that
don't have command functions will need to send the output to a temporary
file and the read it back in with the "." command:

     $  dmalloc -b arguments ... > /tmp/out
     $  . /tmp/out

   By the way, if you are looking for a shell, I heartily recommend
trying out zsh.  It is a bourne shell written from scratch with much
the same features as tcsh without the csh crap.

   _NOTE_: After you add the alias to the file you need to log out and
log back in to have it take effect, or you can execute the above
appropriate command on the command line.  If you enter `dmalloc
runtime' and see any output with DMALLOC_OPTIONS in it then the alias
did not work.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Utility Usage,  Next: Environment Variable,  Prev: Shell Alias,  Up: Dmalloc Program

How to Use the Dmalloc Program
==============================

The most basic usage for the program is `dmalloc [-bC] tag'.  The `-b'
or `-C' (either but not both flags used at a time) are for generating
Bourne or C shell type commands respectively.  dmalloc will try and use
the `SHELL' environment variable to determine whether bourne or C shell
commands should be generated but you may want to explicitly specify the
correct flag.

   The `tag' argument to dmalloc should match a line from the user's
runtime configuration file or should be one of the built-in tags.
*Note RC File::.  If no tag is specified and no other option-commands
used, dmalloc will display the current settings of the environment
variable.  It is useful to specify one of the verbose options when doing
this.

   To find out the usage for the debug malloc program try `dmalloc
--usage-long'.  The standardized usage message that will be displayed is
one of the many features of the argv library included with this package.

   It is available on the web at URL `http://256.com/sources/argv/'.
See the documentation there for more information.

   Here is a detailed list of the flags that can passed to dmalloc:

`-a address'
     Set the `addr' part of the `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' variable to address
     (or alternatively address:number).

`-b'
     Output Bourne shell type commands.

`-C'
     Output C shell type commands.

`-c'
     Clear/unset all of the settings not specified with other
     arguments.  You can do this automatically when you set to a new
     tag with the `-r' option.

     _NOTE_: clear will never unset the `debug' setting.  Use `-d 0' or
     a tag to `none' to achieve this.

`-d bitmask'
     Set the `debug' part of the `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' env variable to the
     bitmask value which should be in hex.  This is overridden (and
     unnecessary) if a tag is specified.

`-D'
     List all of the debug-tokens.  Useful for finding a token to be
     used with the `-p' or `-m' options.  Use with `-v' or `-V' verbose
     options.

`-e errno'
     Print the dmalloc error string that corresponds to the error number
     errno.

`-f filename'
     Use this configuration file instead of the RC file
     `$HOME/.dmallocrc'.

`-i number'
     Set the checking interval to number.  If the `check-heap' token is
     enabled, this causes the library to only check the heap every Nth
     time which can _significantly_ increase the running speed of your
     program.  If a problem is found, however, this limits your ability
     to determine when the problem occurred.  Try values of 50 or 100
     initially.

`-k'
     Do not reset all of the settings when a tag is specified.  This
     specifically overrides the `-r' option and is provided here to
     override `-r' if it has been added to the dmalloc alias.

`-l filename'
     Write the debugging output and other log-file information to the
     filename.  Filename can include some of the following patterns
     which get expanded into strings:

    `%h'
          Gets expanded into the hostname if the `gethostname()'
          function is available.

    `%i'
          Gets expanded into the thread-id if the library has been
          configure to be used with threads.  *Note Using With
          Threads::.  See the end of the `settings.dist' file for
          settings which return the thread-id and convert it into a
          string.

    `%p'
          Gets expanded into the process-id if the `getpid()' function
          is available.

    `%t'
          Gets expanded into the time value in seconds if the `time()'
          function is available.

    `%u'
          Gets expanded into the user-id number if the `getuid()'
          function is available.


     Some examples:

          # logfile produced with pid extension:   logfile.8412  or  logfile.31451
          dmalloc -l logfile.%p
          
          # hostname and time extensions:  dmalloc-box1.foo.com-1055213240
          dmalloc -l dmalloc-%h-%t
          
          # if threads enabled, have thread-id extension:  log.thread32
          dmalloc -l log.thread%i

`-L'
     Output the debug-value not in hex but by individual debug-tokens
     in long form.

`-m token(s)'
     Remove (minus) the debug capabilities of token(s) from the current
     debug setting or from the selected tag (or `-d' value).  Multiple
     `-m' options can be specified.

`-n'
     Without changing the environment, output the commands resulting
     from the supplied options.

`-M limit'
     Set the memory allocation limit which will abort the program if the
     total memory allocations exceed this number of bytes.  The limit
     can be a number with a k, m, or g at the end to indicate kilobyte,
     megabyte, and gigabyte respectively.  Ex: 100k, 200m, 1g.  If the
     limit is exceeded, this will generate an `ERROR_OVER_LIMIT' error.

`-o times'
     Set the "lock-on" period which dictates to the threaded version of
     the library to not initialize or lock the mutex lock around the
     library until after a certain number of allocation calls have been
     made.  Some number between 2 and 30 is probably good.  See the
     "Using With Threads" section for more information about the
     operation of the library with threads.  *Note Using With Threads::.

`-p token(s)'
     Add (plus) the debug capabilities of token(s) to the current debug
     setting or to the selected tag (or `-d' value).  Multiple `-p'
     options can be specified.

`-r'
     Remove (unset) all settings when using a tag.  This is useful when
     you are returning to a standard development tag and want the
     logfile, address, and interval settings to be cleared
     automatically.  If you want this behavior by default, this can be
     put into the dmalloc alias.

`-s file:line'
     Set the `start' part of the `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' env variable to a
     file-name and line-number location in the source where the library
     should begin more extensive heap checking.  The file and line
     numbers for heap transactions must be working for this option to
     be obeyed.  This is used if you are trying to locate a problem and
     you want the extensive checking to not happen initially because
     it's too slow.

`-S number'
     Set the `start' part of the `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' env variable to an
     dmalloc mark number.  The library will begin more extensive heap
     checking after this number of memory transactions.  If you
     `LOG_ITERATION' enabled in your `settings.h' file then the entries
     in the log file will be prepended with the number of memory
     transactions that the library has handled so far.  This number can
     be used to delay the start of the fine grained heap checking which
     can be very slow.

`--start-size size'
     Set the `start' part of the `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' env variable to a
     number of bytes.  The library will begin more extensive heap
     checking after this amount of memory has been allocated by the
     library.  This allows you to start the slow and detailed checking
     of the library later in the program execution.  You can use
     patterns like 250m, 1g, or 102k to mean 250 megabytes, 1 gigabyte,
     and 102 kilobytes respectively.

`-t'
     List all of the tags in the rc-file.  Use with `-v' or `-V'
     verbose options.

`-v'
     Give verbose output.  Especially useful when dumping current
     settings or listing all of the tags.

   If no arguments are specified, dmalloc dumps out the current settings
that you have for the environment variable.  For example:

     Debug-Flags  '0x40005c7' (runtime)
     Address      0x1f008, count = 3
     Interval     100
     Logpath      'malloc'
     Start-File   not-set

   With a -v option and no arguments, dmalloc dumps out the current
settings in a verbose manner.  For example:

     Debug-Flags  '0x40005c7' (runtime)
        log-stats, log-non-free, log-bad-space, check-fence, catch-null
     Address      0x1f008, count = 10
     Interval     100
     Logpath      'malloc'
     Start-File   not-set

   Here are some examples of dmalloc usage:

     # start tough debugging, check the heap every 100 times,
     # send the log information to file 'logfile'
     dmalloc high -i 100 -l logfile
     
     # find out what error code 20 is (from the logfile)
     dmalloc -e 20
     
     # cause the library to halt itself when it sees the address 0x34238
     # for the 6th time.
     dmalloc -a 0x34238:6
     
     # send the log information to file 'logfile' with the time in seconds
     # as an extension.
     dmalloc -l logfile.%t
     
     # return to the normal 'runtime' settings and clear out all
     # other settings
     dmalloc -c runtime
     
     # enable basic 'low' settings plus (-p) the logging of
     # transactions (log-trans) to file 'logfile'
     dmalloc low -p log-trans -l logfile
     
     # print out the current settings with Very-verbose output
     dmalloc -V
     
     # list the available debug malloc tokens with Very-verbose output
     dmalloc -DV
     
     # list the available tags from the rc file with verbose output
     dmalloc -tv

Environment Variable Name and Features
======================================

An "environment variable" is a variable that is part of the user's
working environment and is shared by all the programs.  The
`DMALLOC_OPTIONS' variable is used by the dmalloc library to enable or
disable the memory debugging features, at runtime.  _NOTE:_ you can
also use the dmalloc_debug_setup function to set the option string.  It
can be set either by hand or with the help of the dmalloc program.
*Note Dmalloc Program::.

   To set it by hand, Bourne shell (sh, bash, ksh, or zsh) users should
use:

     DMALLOC_OPTIONS=value
     export DMALLOC_OPTIONS

   C shell (csh or tcsh) users need to invoke:

     setenv DMALLOC_OPTIONS value

   The value in the above examples is a comma separated list of tokens
each having a corresponding value.  The tokens are described below:

`debug'
     This should be set to a value in hexadecimal which corresponds to
     the functionality token values added together.  *Note Debug
     Tokens::.  For instance, if the user wanted to enable the logging
     of memory transactions (value `0x008') and wanted to check
     fence-post memory (value `0x400') then `debug' should be set to
     `0x408' (`0x008' + `0x400').

     _NOTE_: You don't have to worry about remembering all the hex
     values of the tokens because the dmalloc program automates the
     setting of this variable especially.

     _NOTE_: You can also specify the debug tokens directly, separated
     by commas.  *Note Debug Tokens::.  If `debug' and the tokens are
     both used, the token values will be added to the debug value.

`lockon'
     Set this to a number which is the "lock-on" period.  This dictates
     to the threaded version of the library to not initialize or lock
     the mutex lock around the library until after a certain number of
     allocation calls have been made.  See the "Using With Threads"
     section for more information about the operation of the library
     with threads.  *Note Using With Threads::.

`log'
     Set this to a filename so that if `debug' has logging enabled, the
     library can log transactions, administration information, and/or
     errors to the file so memory problems and usage can be tracked.

     To get different logfiles for different processes, you can assign
     `log' to a string with `%d' in it (for instance `logfile.%d').
     This will be replaced with the pid of the running process (for
     instance `logfile.2451').

     _WARNING_: it is easy to core dump any program with dmalloc, if
     you send in a format with arguments other than the one `%d'.

`addr'
     When this is set to a hex address (taken from the dmalloc log-file
     for instance) dmalloc will abort when it finds itself either
     allocating or freeing that address.

     The address can also have an `:number' argument.  For instance, if
     it was set it to `0x3e45:10', the library will kill itself the 10th
     time it sees address `0x3e45'.  By setting the number argument to
     0, the program will never stop when it sees the address.  This is
     useful for logging all activity on the address and makes it easier
     to track down specific addresses not being freed.

     This works well in conjunction with the `STORE_SEEN_COUNT' option.
     *Note Memory Leaks::.

     _NOTE_: dmalloc will also log all activity on this address along
     with a count.

`inter'
     By setting this to a number X, dmalloc will only check the heap
     every X times.  This means a number of debugging features can be
     enabled while still running the program within a finite amount of
     time.

     A setting of `100' works well with reasonably memory intensive
     programs.  This of course means that the library will not catch
     errors exactly when they happen but possibly 100 library calls
     later.

`start'
     Set this to a number X and dmalloc will begin checking the heap
     after X times.  This means the intensive debugging can be started
     after a certain point in a program.

     `start' also has the format `file:line'.  For instance, if it is
     set to `dmalloc_t.c:126' dmalloc will start checking the heap
     after it sees a dmalloc call from the `dmalloc_t.c' file, line
     number 126.  If you use `dmalloc_t.c:0', with a 0 line number, then
     dmalloc will start checking the heap after it sees a call from
     anywhere in the `dmalloc_t.c' file.

     This allows the intensive debugging to be started after a certain
     routine or file has been reached in the program.

   Some examples are:

     # turn on transaction and stats logging and set 'logfile' as the log-file
     setenv DMALLOC_OPTIONS log-trans,log-stats,log=logfile
     
     # enable debug flags 0x1f as well as heap-checking and set the interval
     # to be 100
     setenv DMALLOC_OPTIONS debug=0x1f,check-heap,inter=100
     
     # enable 'logfile' as the log-file, watch for address '0x1234', and start
     # checking when we see file.c line 123
     setenv DMALLOC_OPTIONS log=logfile,addr=0x1234,start=file.c:123

Description of the Debugging Tokens
===================================

The below tokens and their corresponding descriptions are for the
setting of the debug library setting in the environment variable.
*Note Environment Variable::.  They should be specified in the user's
`.dmallocrc' file.  *Note RC File::.

   Each token, when specified, enables a specific debugging feature.
For instance, if you have the log-stats token enabled, the library will
log general statistics to the logfile.

   To get this information on the fly, use `dmalloc -DV'.  This will
print out the Debug tokens in Very-verbose mode.  *Note Dmalloc
Program::.

`none'
     No debugging functionality

`log-stats'
     Log general statistics when dmalloc_shutdown or dmalloc_log_stats
     is called.

`log-non-free'
     Log non-freed memory pointers when dmalloc_shutdown or
     dmalloc_log_unfreed is called.

`log-known'
     Log only known memory pointers that have not been freed.  Pointers
     which do not have file/line or return-address information will not
     be logged.

`log-trans'
     Log general memory transactions (quite verbose).

`log-admin'
     Log administrative information (quite verbose).

`log-bad-space'
     Log actual bytes in and around bad pointers.

`log-nonfree-space'
     Log actual bytes in non-freed pointers.

`log-elapsed-time'
     Log elapsed-time for allocated pointers (see `conf.h').

`log-current-time'
     Log current-time for allocated pointers (see `conf.h').

`check-fence'
     Check fence-post memory areas.

`check-heap'
     Verify heap administrative structure.

`check-blank'
     Check to see if space that was blanked by free-blank or
     alloc-blank has been overwritten.  If this is enabled then it will
     enable free-blank and alloc-blank automatically.

`check-funcs'
     Check the arguments of some functions (mostly string operations)
     looking for bad pointers.

`check-shutdown'
     Check all of the pointers in the heap when the program exits.

`catch-signals'
     Shutdown the library automatically on SIGHUP, SIGINT, or SIGTERM.
     This will cause the library to dump its statistics (if requested)
     when you press control-c on the program (for example).

`realloc-copy'
     Always copy data to a new pointer when realloc.

`free-blank'
     Write special "dmalloc-free" byte (hexadecimal `0xdf', octal
     `0337', decimal `223') into space when it is freed.  You can set
     this to be something else in the `settings.dist' file.  You can
     then check to see if areas have been improperly overwritten with
     the `check-blank' token.  If the free space has been overwritten,
     then ERROR_FREE_OVERWRITTEN is triggered.

`error-abort'
     Abort the program (and dump core) on errors.  See `error-dump'
     below.

`alloc-blank'
     Write special "dmalloc-alloc" byte (hexadecimal `0xda', octal
     `0332', decimal `218') into space when it is allocated.  You can
     set this to be something else in the `settings.dist' file.  You
     can then check to see if areas have been improperly overwritten
     with the check-blank token.

`print-messages'
     Log any errors and messages to the screen via standard-error.

`catch-null'
     Abort the program immediately if the library fails to get more heap
     space from the heap allocation routine `mmap' or `sbrk'.

`never-reuse'
     Have the heap never use space that has been used before and freed.
     *Note Memory Leaks::.  _WARNING_: This should be used with caution
     since you may run out of heap space.

`error-dump'
     Dump core on error and then continue.  Later core dumps overwrite
     earlier ones if the program encounters more than one error.  See
     `error-abort' above.

     _NOTE_: This will only work if your system supports the `fork'
     system call and the configuration utility was able to fork without
     going recursive.

`error-free-null'
     By default the library will not generate an error when a program
     tries to free a NULL pointer.  By enabling this token, you can
     change this behavior so an error is reported.  See also the
     ALLOW_FREE_NULL and ALLOW_FREE_NULL_MESSAGE settings in the
     `settings.h' file to change the default behavior.



File: dmalloc.info,  Node: RC File,  Prev: Debug Tokens,  Up: Dmalloc Program

Format of the Runtime Configuration File
========================================

By using a "RC File" (or runtime configuration file) you can alias tags
to combinations of debug tokens.  *Note Debug Tokens::.

   _NOTE_: For beginning users, the dmalloc program has a couple of
tags built into it so it is not necessary for you to setup a RC file:

`runtime'
     Enables basic runtime tests including fence-post checking, null
     handling, and logging of any errors.

`low'
     Runtime settings plus minimal checking of heap structures and
     overwriting of allocated and freed space.

`medium'
     Low settings plus checking of all heap structures on each memory
     call, always relocates block on realloc, and aborts on errors.
     You may want to use `-i' option to the dmalloc utility.  *Note
     Dmalloc Program::.

`high'
     Medium settings plus checking of overwritten freed and allocated
     memory and checking of arguments to a number of common functions.
     You may want to use `-i' option to the dmalloc utility.  *Note
     Dmalloc Program::.


   For expert users, a sample `dmallocrc' file has been provided but
you are encouraged to roll your own combinations.  The name of default
rc-file is `$HOME/.dmallocrc'.  The `$HOME' environment variable should
be set by the system to point to your home-directory.

   The file should contain lines in the general form of:

     tag     token1, token2, ...

   `tag' is to be matched with the tag argument passed to the dmalloc
program, while `token1, token2, ...' are debug capability tokens.
*Note Dmalloc Program::, *Note Debug Tokens::.

   A line can be finished with a `\' meaning it continues onto the next
line.  Lines beginning with `#' are treated as comments and are ignored
along with empty lines.

   Here is an example of a `.dmallocrc' file:

     #
     # Dmalloc runtime configuration file for the debug malloc library
     #
     
     # no debugging
     none    none
     
     # basic debugging
     debug1  log-stats, log-non-free, check-fence
     
     # more logging and some heap checking
     debug2  log-stats, log-non-free, log-trans, \
             check-fence, check-heap, error-abort
     
     # good utilities
     debug3  log-stats, log-non-free, log-trans, \
             log-admin, check-fence, check-heap, realloc-copy, \
             free-blank, error-abort
     
     ...

   For example, with the above file installed, you can type `dmalloc
debug1' after setting up your shell alias.  *Note Dmalloc Program::.
This enables the logging of statistics, the logging of non-freed memory,
and the checking of fence-post memory areas.

   Enter `dmalloc none' to disable all memory debugging features.

Definition of Terms and other Information
=========================================

Here are a couple definitions and other information for those interested
in "picking the brain" of the library.  The code is a little ugly here
and there and it conforms to the Gray-Watson handbook of coding
standards only.

"bblock"
     basic block containing 2 ^ BASIC_BLOCK bytes of info

"bblock_adm"
     administration for a set of basic blocks

"dblock"
     divided block containing some base 2 number of blocks smaller than
     a basic block.

"dblock_adm"
     administration for a set of divided blocks

"chunk"
     some anonymous amount of memory

   For more information about administration structures, see the code
and comments from `chunk_loc.h'.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Compatibility,  Next: Portability,  Prev: Definitions,  Up: Source Code

General Compatibility Concerns
==============================

   * Realloc() backwards compatibility with being able to realloc from
     the last freed block is _not_ supported.  The author is interested
     to know who is using this (cough, cough) feature and for what
     reason.

   * Realloc() of a NULL pointer is supported in which case the library
     will just make a call to malloc().  This can be disabled with the
     help of a manual compilation option in the `conf.h' file.

   * Some systems allow free(0) to not be an error for some reason.
     Since 0 is not a valid address returned by the malloc call, it is
     debatable that this should be allowed.  See `conf.h' for some
     manual compilation options to handle this.

   * Aside from possibly being slower than the system's memory
     allocation functions, the library should be fully compatible with
     the standard memory routines.  If this is _not_ the case, please
     bring this to my attention.


File: dmalloc.info,  Node: Portability,  Prev: Compatibility,  Up: Source Code

Issues Important for Porting the Library
========================================

General portability issues center around:

   * mmap, sbrk, or compatible function usages.  The library does
     support a preallocated memory chunk heap.  See the
     `INTERNAL_MEMORY_SPACE' define in the `settings.dist' file.

   * The locating of the caller's address from the dmalloc functions.
     This is useful in locating problems from dmalloc functions called
     from C files which did not include `dmalloc.h': C library calls for
     instance.

     See `return.h' for the available architecture/compiler
     combinations.  You may want to examine the assembly code from gcc
     (GNUs superior c-compiler) version 2+ being run on the following
     code.  It should give you a good start on building a hack for your
     box.

          static char * x;
          
          a()
          {
                  x = __builtin_return_address(0);
          }
          
          main()
          {
                  a();
          }



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some Solutions to Common Problems
*********************************

This section provides some answers to some common problems and
questions.  Please send me mail with any additions to this list -
either problems you are still having or tips that you would like to
pass on.

   When diagnosing a problem, if possible, always make sure you are
running the most up to date version of Dmalloc available from the home
page at URL `http://dmalloc.com/'.  Problems are often fixed and a new
release can be published before people encounter them.

`Why does my program run so slow?'
     This library has never been (and maybe never will be) optimized for
     space nor speed.  Some of its features make it unable to use some
     of the organizational methods of other more efficient heap
     libraries.

     If you have the `check-heap' token enabled, you can have the
     library check itself less frequently by using the `-i' option to
     the dmalloc utility.  *Note Dmalloc Program::.  If you are using
     the `high' token and you need your program to run faster, try the
     `medium' or `low' tokens which don't check as many heap features
     and so run faster although they will not catch as many problems.
     *Note RC File::.

`Why was a log-file not produced after I ran my program?'
     This could be caused by a number of different problems.

       1. Are you sure you followed all of the items in the "Getting
          Started" section?  Please review them if there is any doubt.
          *Note Getting Started::.

       2. Use the `env' or `printenv' commands to make sure that the
          `DMALLOC_OPTIONS' variable is set in your exported
          environment.  *Note Environment Variable::.

       3. Make sure that your program has been compiled correctly with
          the dmalloc library.  The `ident' program should show chunk.c
          and other dmalloc files compiled into your program.  You can
          also do `strings -a your-program | grep chunk.c' and look for
          something like `$Id: chunk.c,v 1.152 1999/08/25 12:37:01 gray
          Exp $' with different versions and date information.  If this
          doesn't show up then chances are dmalloc was not linked into
          your program.

       4. If your program changes its working directory, it may write
          the dmalloc log-file somewhere else in the filesystem.  You
          will need to check both where the program was started and to
          where it might change directory.

       5. The logfile is only produced when `dmalloc_shutdown()' is
          called.  By default it will be called when `exit()' gets
          called.  If you are running your program and press
          `Control-C' under Unix the program will stop immediately and
          `dmalloc_shutdown()' will not get called.  You can either
          setup a signal handler for `SIGINTR' and call exit yourself,
          or you can enable the `catch-signals' token.  *Note Debug
          Tokens::.

       6. If your program is segfaulting or otherwise crashing when it
          exits, the `exit()' routine may not being called.  You will
          have to resolve these issues so the dmalloc library can
          gracefully exit and write its log file.

       7. You may want to call `dmalloc_log_stats()' and
          `dmalloc_log_unfreed()' (or `dmalloc_log_changed()') directly
          to have the library write its log file.  Some system modules
          may not have shutdown if you call this before `exit()' so
          extra unfreed memory may be reported.


`I don't see any information about my non-freed (leaked) memory?'
     The library will not (by default) report on "unknown" non-freed
     memory.  Unknown means memory that does not have associated file
     and line information.

     This will be necessary if you are _not_ including `dmalloc.h' in
     all of your C files or if you are interested in tracking leaks in
     system functions.

`Dmalloc is returning the error "malloc library has gone recursive"'
     This most likely indicates that you are using the Dmalloc library
     within a threaded application and two threads are trying to use
     the dmalloc library at once.  Please see the section of the manual
     about threads for more information about properly configuring the
     library.  *Note Using With Threads::.

     If you are not using threads, then your program could have caught a
     signal while within Dmalloc, which then in turn called a memory
     allocation routine.  It is unwise to allocate memory on the heap
     in most signal handlers.  Lastly, some functions called by the
     library may call memory routines that it does not anticipate.  If
     you think this the case, please report the problem and include a
     stack trace, operating system version/type, and the version of
     Dmalloc you are using.
