Xenomai Simulator (aka Minute Virtual Machine)
==============================================

Using the simulator to run your real-time applications has a lot of
advantages: it's faster, does not require the cross-development tools,
gives extended debugging, monitoring and tracing features and provides
an easy way to stress the application under test with run-time
situations otherwise barely conceivable on a real target (e.g. bursts
of simulated interrupts generated at a very unreasonable rate!). Of
course, the application should not contain target-dependent code, such
as assembly code, because it runs as a regular executable compiled by
GCC on your GNU/Linux workstation. You cannot use the simulator to
collect accurate performance footprints of your system, but it can
show you precisely how the multiple threads running in your system
work together sharing the resources exported by the real-time
interface.

Since the simulator is based on an event-driven simulation engine, it
does not rely on the host's "wall clock" but instead provides its own
simulated timeline to schedule the events that occur within a system,
a given test scenario can be repeated very simply an infinite number
of times, with no perturbation from the outside world (e.g. the
current load of the host and so on). In other words, a given line of
source code will always be executed by the virtual machine at the same
time in the system's timeline across multiple runs. This is a very
desirable feature when debugging synchronization problems.

Building the simulator
======================

You will need the libelf, libpng, tcl8.x/tk8.x and tix41 _development
packages_ in order to build the simulator and its companion tools.
For instance, on Debian systems, you will need to install
libelfg0-dev, libpng2-dev, tcl8.3-dev, tk8.3-dev and tix41-dev (any
tcl/tk version starting from 8.0 is ok though). A _source_ archive of
GCC 2.95.3 is also required to produce a tool that will instrument the
code running on top of the virtual machine. You will not need to build
this compiler by yourself, just have the archive file at hand, so the
build procedure can find it, patch it, and install the resulting
programs appropriately (you can fetch the GCC archive at
http://gcc.gnu.org/).

Since v2.1, the simulator is available as a separate tarball, distinct
from the main Xenomai archive. To build the simulator, you will also
need the latter; the simulator archive should be extracted in
Xenomai's main source tree under the sim/ sub-directory. The following
steps should be followed in order to build and install the simulation
system:

# $xenomai_tar: Main Xenomai tarball
# $xenosim_tar: Simulator tarball
# $xenomai_src: Root of Xenomai's source tree after extraction
# $sim_builddir: Build root for the simulator
# $sim_installdir: Installation directory for the simulator;
# (usually, the same place than used for Xenomai's main system).
# gcc_tarball: Path to a GCC 2.95.3 source archive.

$ tar jxf $xenomai_tar
$ cd xenomai-2.X.Y
$ tar jxf $xenosim_tar
$ mkdir $sim_builddir && cd $sim_builddir
$ $xenomai_src/xenosim-X.Y.Z/configure --prefix=$sim_installdir --with-gcc-tarball=$gcc_tarball
$ make install
