.SH NAME
mode2, smode2, xmode2 - shows the pulse/space length of infrared signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmode2
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The main purpose of these programs is to check operation of your
home-brew LIRC receiver hardware and to see the IR waveform of the
remote controller without an expensive oscilloscope. Very useful for
debugging. Of course this program won't work with hardware that decodes
the signals itself like e.g. TV cards or the Irman.


xmode2 is based on smode2 by Sinkovics Zoltan. It is just a conversion
from svga to X with some basic support for resizing. The only
differences are that the --mode option enables an alternative display
mode and that xmode2 can read and visualise mode2 output from stdin.
