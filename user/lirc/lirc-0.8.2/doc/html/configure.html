    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Using multiple different devices simultaneously</H1>
    <HR WIDTH="70%">
    
    <P>
      There are some situations when you might want to use multiple
      devices with LIRC simultaneously. E.g. you might have a TV card
      receiver and want to control your set-top box with a home-brew
      serial port transmitter at the same time. Or you might have a
      serial port receiver connected to your PC and a different
      network connected receiver (UDP, different LIRC/WinLIRC
      instance) in a different room.
    </P>
    <P>
      The configuration depends much on the type of devices you want
      to use. If you are using devices that require a kernel module,
      then you should first compile and install LIRC individually for
      each device, basically just to get all required kernel modules
      installed. The further steps depend on which user-space driver
      is used in lircd for your devices. Most devices (actually all
      devices that use a kernel module) use the <em>default</em>
      driver. You can check which user-space is used for your device
      by running <em>lircd --driver=?</em>. Remember that this might
      change each time you compile lircd for a different device. If
      you want to use devices that use different user-space drivers
      then you have to compile LIRC once again using <em>./configure
      --with-driver=any</em>. This will compile almost any user-space
      driver into lircd that is available (but does not compile any
      kernel modules, that's why you had to build them individually
      before). After that you should check if the drivers you want are
      listed now with <em>lircd --driver=?</em>. You should get
      something like this:
    </P>
<pre>
> lircd --driver=?

</pre>
    <P>
      If you want to use more than one device that uses a kernel
      module you should now have a look at the character device setup
      in /dev/. Each LIRC kernel module provides a device with major
      number 61 and a minor number beginning at 0 which is counted up
      every time a new driver is loaded (note: both the major number
      and the minor number concept are subject to change in future
      LIRC releases). If you want to use two devices then the LIRC
      related files in /dev/ should look something like this (this
      might be done automatically if you are using devfs or sysfs):
    </P>
<pre>
&gt; ls -l /dev/lirc*
crw-r--r--    1 root     root      61,   0 Apr 25  2001 /dev/lirc
crw-r--r--    1 root     root      61,   1 Nov  6 19:24 /dev/lirc1
srw-rw-rw-    1 root     root            0 Dez 19 09:44 /dev/lircd
prw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Okt 10 21:16 /dev/lircm
</pre>
    <P>
      You can create new entries by running:
    </P>
<pre>
&gt; mknod /dev/lirc2 c 61 2
</pre>
    <P>
      For each device you want to use you have to start an individual
      lircd instance. If you want to receive events from all receivers
      at one socket interface you have to connect the different lircd
      interfaces with an additional TCP/IP socket. This could look
      e.g. like this:
    </P>
<pre>
&gt; lircd --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc1 --output=/dev/lircd1 \
    --pidfile=/var/run/lircd1.pid --listen
&gt; lircd --driver=default --device=/dev/lirc --output=/dev/lircd \
    --pidfile=/var/run/lircd.pid --connect=localhost:8765
</pre>
    <P>
      All events will now be visible at /dev/lircd. The second lircd
      instance connects to the first instance using a TCP/IP
      socket. The default port is 8765. It can be changed by providing
      an optional parameter to the <em>--listen</em> switch. If you
      have more lircd instances you want to connect to, you can
      provide multiple <em>--connect</em> parameters to the last lircd
      instance. Please note that lircd will not relay events received
      from one lircd to another. So you can't daisy-chain
      lircds. Instead you need a star topology setup.
    </P>
      In order to check each lircd instance individually if events are
      being received, just use irw providing the according socket
      interface on the command line:
<pre>
&gt; irw /dev/lircd1
</pre>
    <P>
      Also using a special lircd instance to send infra-red commands
      is quite easy: use the --device command line option of irsend to
      provide the desired socket interface.
    </P>
    <P>
      The only situation where the described procedure will not work
      is when you have two devices that both use a kernel driver that
      can only handle one device at once like e.g. lirc_serial,
      lirc_sir or lirc_parallel. You can still make it work with a
      trick by compiling the affected driver multiple times using
      different names and different major numbers. You will find
      detailed instructions how to achieve this by searching the
      mailing list. Lifting this limitation is one of the todo items
      for future releases.

    <!-- lircmd.conf +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    
    <A NAME="lircmd.conf"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Configuring lircmd (the LIRC mouse daemon)</H1>
    <HR WIDTH="70%">
    
    <P>
      <em>lircmd</em> can be used to emulate a mouse with your remote
      control. Depending on the config file described in the next
      section it converts IR signals into mouse events. It currently
      supports three mouse protocols (MouseSystems, IntelliMouse and
      IMPS/2). For compatibility reasons the default protocol is the
      MouseSystems protocol but the preferred is the IntelliMouse
      protocol. The advantage of this protocol is its wheel-mouse
      support. That way you can for example configure Netscape to
      scroll if you press certain buttons.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      IMPS/2 used to be the preferred protocol since it also has
      wheel-mouse support and IntelliMouse was not available. However
      PS/2 protocol specifies that the mouse must accept and reply to
      specific commands, and that can not be done through the pipe
      <em>lircmd</em> uses. For this reason IntelliMouse support was
      written and is currently the preferred protocol.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      lircmd can basically be used with two applications: X11 and gpm<BR>

    <P>
      Make sure you use a current version of X11. There seems to be a
      bug in X version 3.3 that can make X crash if you use both mouse
      and remote control mouse simultaneously. At least I couldn't
      reproduce this with other versions. I also received some notes
      that lircmd does not work with certain X11 versions. But almost
      always at least one of the protocols did work. So try them all
      before trying another X11 version. But always remember that you
      have to modify both XF86Config and lircmd.conf so they use the
      same protocol.

      This instructs lircmd to reread its config file. The same is

      At this point all you need are the tools, which react on the
      signals decoded by lircd. To do this you need a file called
      <em>.lircrc</em>. It should be placed in your home
      directory. Optionally you can create a system-wide configuration
      file located in /etc/lircrc, which will be used when no .lircrc
      file can be found in the user's home directory. The idea is to
      have configuration information of all clients in one place. That
      lets you keep a better overview of clients and simplifies the
      use of modes explained later.
    </P>
    <P>
      First I will explain the syntax of the .lircrc file itself.  The
      config file for LIRC tools consists of one or more of the
      following constructions:
    </P>
    <PRE>
    begin
	prog	= ...
	remote	= ...
	button	= ...
	repeat	= ...
	delay	= ...

	flags	= ...
    end</PRE>
    <P>
      Bringing it to the point the above says which program
      (<em>prog</em>) should do what (<em>config</em>, <em>mode</em>,
      <em>flags</em>) if you press a certain button (<em>remote</em>,
      <em>button</em>) a specified time (<em>repeat</em>,
      <em>delay</em>).
    </P>
    <DL>
      <DT>prog</DT>
      <DD>gives the name of the program that should receive the
	configstring given in config.
      </DD>
      <DT>remote, button</DT>
      <DD>specify a key of a remote control that launches an
	action. Key sequences can be specified by giving more then one
	remote/button string. The character '*' can be used as a wild
	card for remote or button. The default for remote is '*'. The
	remote name must always be given before its according
	button. When using key sequences a given remote is valid for
	all following buttons until you specify another remote.
      </DD>
      <DT>repeat</DT>
      <DD>tells the program what shall happen if a key is repeated.  A
	value of zero tells the program to ignore repeated keys.  Any
	other positive value 'n' tells the program to pass the config
	string every 'n'-th time to the according application, when a
	key is repeated. The default for repeat is zero.
      </DD>
      <DT>delay</DT>
      <DD>tells the program to ignore the specified number of key repeats
	before using the &quot;repeat&quot; configuration directive
	above. This is used to prevent double triggers of events when
	using a fast repeat rate. A value of zero, which also is the
	default, will disable the delay function.
      </DD>
      <DT>config</DT>
      <DD>is the string that will be passed to the according
	application whenever the specified key sequence is received by
	lircd. If you give more than one config string, the config
	strings will be passed to the applications by turns. With this
	feature you can for example implement toggle buttons.<BR>
	
	You can pass non-printable characters to applications with all
	standard C escape sequences (most common are: \n = line-feed,
	\r = carriage return, \t = tab, \e = escape,
	\&lt;<em>n</em>&gt; = ASCII code in octal representation,
	\x&lt;<em>n</em>&gt; = ASCII code in hexadecimal
	representation, \\ = backslash). Additionally you can supply
	Ctrl-X by specifying \X where X is an upper character or
	@. For example \C is Ctrl-C.
      </DD>
      <DT>mode</DT>
      <DD>tells the program to enter a special mode. You can group
	several configurations by putting them into the following,
	where mode stands for the mode where these configurations
	should be active: 
	
	<PRE>
    begin mode
	...
    end mode</PRE>
	
	If mode is equal to the name of a client application this
	application will always start in this mode. Consider this
	situation: you want to start <em>xawtv</em> with
	<em>irexec</em> and enter the <em>tv</em> mode. Then irexec
	would enter the tv mode but xawtv would begin without any mode
	enabled. By renaming the mode from <em>tv</em> to
	<em>xawtv</em> you can solve this problem.

	<br>Another way to specify a startup mode is by using the
	startup_mode flag as described below.<BR>
	<BR>
	<em>Caveat:</em> In order to avoid many identical entries all
	actions that modify the mode a program currently is in are
	independent of the <em>prog</em> token.
      </DD>
    </DL>
    The following are valid flags:
    <DL>
      <DT>once</DT>
      
      <DD>
	This is only allowed in conjunction with the mode
	directive. The config string is passed to the application only
	the first time the mode is entered or you have explicitly left
	this mode. This is useful for starting an application whenever
	you enter a special mode.
      </DD>
      <DT>quit</DT>
      <DD>Usually all configurations are examined if they have
	to be executed. You can stop this immediately with this flag.
      </DD>
      <DT>mode</DT>
      <DD>This is only allowed within a mode block. It tells the
	program to leave this mode.
      </DD>
      <DT>startup_mode</DT>
      <DD>
	Tells the program to start in the mode given in the mode
	keyword.  The following example tells the program to start in
	the <em>browser</em> mode
	<PRE>
begin
	flags = startup_mode
	mode = browser
end</PRE>
      </DD>
    </DL>
    
    <P>
      It is possible to split the lirc configuration into several
      files by using the <em>include</em> command. It tells the parser
      to read the specified file before resuming the current one:
    </P>
    <PRE>
include ~/.lirc/xawtv</PRE>
    <P>
      If the specified filename begins with &quot;~/&quot;,
      &quot;~&quot; will be substituted with the content of the
      <em>HOME</em> environment variable. The filename also can be put
      inside &lt;&gt; and &quot;&quot; characters which in contrast to
      the C preprocessor do not have special meanings.
    </P>
    <P>
      Ok, now a simple example for a <em>.lircrc</em> file (supposed
      you use an AnimaX remote and use the sample files for this
      remote from the remotes/ directory. If you have another remote
      change <em>remote=</em> and <em>button=</em> according to your
      remote [this definitions are made in the <em>lircd.conf</em>
      file] )
    </P>
    
    <PRE>
    begin
        remote = ANIMAX
        button = MENU_DOWN
        prog   = irexec
        repeat = 0
        config = echo &quot;Hello world!&quot;
    end</PRE>
    <P>
      If you have saved this as <em>.lircrc</em> in your home
      directory, start <em>irexec</em>. Press the button which is
      selected in the <em>button=</em> line and you will see a 'Hello
      world!' on your screen. As you can see irexec is a simple
      program launcher. Of course you can do a lot more than just
      start programs.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      If you start a LIRC client program, it reads your ~/.lircrc and
      reacts only on prog= entries which point to itself. All programs
      should give you the possibility to use an alternative config
      file. If you have included more than one program in your
      .lircrc, then start all these programs, they react only to their
      according entries in .lircrc. This also leads to a disadvantage
      of the mode concept. If you don't start all client programs at a
      time the mode they have to maintain may differ between
      applications. Also key sequences might not be recognized equally
      because all programs then don't have the same starting point. In
      order to solve this problem there is the new <A
      HREF="lircrcd.html">lircrcd</A> program since version
      0.8.0. lircrcd's purpose is to synchronise all clients and
      maintain the current mode. In order to use the lircrcd feature
      you have to explicitly enable it by adding the following line at
      the beginning of the file:
<pre>
#! lircrcd
</pre>
    </P>
