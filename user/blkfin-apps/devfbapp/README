Instruction for Installing The Video Driver and Running Sample Application devtest on EZKIT

1.	Make sure that uClibc is installed, Data cache disabled, and instruction cache enabled.
2.	In the menuconfig select support for frame buffer devices and blackfin AD7171 video encoder on uClinux under the graphics option.
3.	Apply the patch (patch po <patch_name).
4.	Do make.
5.	Load the linux image on the board.
6.	When kernel prompt appears run devtest application by typing devtest on the command prompt.
7.	It is important to note that if size of SDRAM is made less than 32(for ezkit) buffer allocation takes place at lower memory banks and that causes degradation of performance.
8.	It has been observed that performace improves significantly if " DMA has priority over core for ext. accesses" option is enalbed(for .3 silicon), and this is eexpected.
