#
# This file describes how to set various paths used by programs in inetutils.
#
# The rules that determine what a given PATH_FOO define expands to are:
#  (1) If the user specifies --with-path-foo, that value is used.
#  (2) If _PATH_FOO is defined in <paths.h>, that value is used.
#  (3) The lines below are consulted.  They are whitespace-separated
#      lists of things to try, in order.  The various sorts of entries are:
#
#       "value" -- If a file VALUE exists, use VALUE; if no default yet, set
#       	   it to VALUE.  If VALUE begins with a make-variable of the
#		   form `$(NAME)' and a corresponding shell-variable $NAME
#		   exists at configure time, the value of $NAME is substituted
#		   for the $(NAME) for testing (but not subsitution) purposes.
#	test:T	-- Use `test -T' to test for file existance
#	x	-- The same as test:x
#       d       -- The same as test:d
#	c	-- The same as test:c
#	b	-- The same as test:b
#	<ach.h>:SYMBOL
#		-- If SYMBOL is defined in <ack.h>, use SYM
#       <ack.h> -- The same as <ack.h>:_PATH_FOO
#       search:NAME:PATH
#		-- Search for NAME in the colon-separated path PATH, and use
#		   the first thing found; if the `:PATH' is omitted, it
#		   uses the environment variable $PATH
#	no	-- Set the default to `no' (even if there's already a default).
#       FILE	-- The same as "FILE" (the quoted syntax only need be used if
#		   the contents could match one of the special syntaxes)
#
#      If cross-compiling then every file-existance test is made to fail
#      (regardless of what exists on the compilation system), forcing
#      defaults to be used for paths not defined in any header file.  A
#      warning message is printed by configure in this case, as the user may
#      have to define many paths by hand.
#
#      If none of the things in the list matches a real file, the default is
#      used, or `no' if there is none (this means that no path may ever have
#      the value `no', but that's probably not a severe problem).
#
#  (4) If the resulting value is the string `no', then PATH_FOO is never
#      defined by any method (programs that use it should check that it's
#      defined before using it).
#
# Programs wanting to use a particular path PATH_FOO should:
#  (1) Add the make variable $(PATHDEF_FOO) to CPPFLAGS while compiling (this
#      expands either into either -D... for the path variable, or nothing).
#  (2) Include any appropriate headers to match <header.h> entries below
#
