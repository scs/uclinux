   2.
      Support Bluetechnix CM Platform, which is also based on BF533.
   3.
      Enable module support in default configuration and generate module dependency file for modprobe.
   4.
      Upgrade to mainline source code
          *
            Upgrade uClibc to version 0.9.27.

Build Procedure

1. Install Toolchain Release 2005R4

Go to http://blackfin.uclinux.org/frs/?group_id=18 for more information

2. Download the source code of project uClinux for Blackfin release 2005R4

Go to http://blackfin.uclinux.org/frs/?group_id=17

3. Uncompress uclinux-dist.tar.bz to working directory

cp uClinux-dist_2005R4.tar.bz /(WORK_DIR)
cd /(WORK_DIR)
bunzip2 uClinux-dist_2005R4.tar.bz
tar -xvf uClinux-dist_2005R4.tar

4. Compile the source using following commands

cd uClinux-dist
make clean 
make menuconfig (save and exit without making any changes)
make 

5. Find the compiled blackfin executable linux in the following location

$(WORK_DIR)/uClinux-dist/images 

6. Above file shall be used to download to the target board.
Load Kernel to Target Board

1. Use below serial cables to connect board to host computer.

Male-Female 1-1 serial cable

2. Use minicom or some other serial communications utility to configure the serial port with the following parameters. If run minicom for the first time, run “minicom -s” to setup the port.

Serial Device = /dev/ttyS0
Baud Rate = Baud that have been selected in kernel menuconfig (Default value is 57600)
Number of bits = 8
Parity = None
Stop bits = 1

3. Make sure the BMODE pins on the target board are set to 00. If u-boot loads automatically on reset, the pins are already set correctly.

4. Make sure tftp server is installed in the host machine. Copy linux from uClinux-dist/images/ that is built in above steps to the /tftpboot of the host PC.

5. Load the linux file with the following bootloader commands. Make sure the ipaddr (target board IP) and serverip (host IP) are correct.

STAMP> setenv ipaddr x.y.z.n
STAMP> setenv serverip x.y.z.m 
STAMP> saveenv
STAMP> tftp 0x1000000 linux
STAMP> bootelf 0x1000000

 	Where x.y.z.m is the ip address of the host machine, and x.y.z.n is the ip address of the target board.

6. The kernel should then boot
Adding / upgrading kernel in flash
Building Linux image (compressed and uncompressed)

(This Image Will be Used in bootm command) Linux ELF image has to be changed as per u-boot standards to load Linux using bootm command. Following subsections explain how to build compressed and uncompressed Linux images.
Building Compressed Linux Image

Compressed Linux images can be found under folder “uClinux-dist/image”. But, you can also generate by yourself as follows.

1. Generate the binary file from the ELF file, using following command

$ bfin-uclinux-objcopy -O binary linux linux.bin 

2. Compress the binary file obtained above, using following command

$ gzip -9 linux.bin  

3. Build the final linux image, using following command

(WORK_DIR)/u-boot_1.1.3/tools/mkimage -A blackfin -O linux -T kernel -C gzip -a 0x1000 
-e 0x1000 -n "Bfin uClinux Kernel" -d linux.bin.gz uImage

 	Use the utility mkimage present in the u-boot_1.1.3/tools directory to merge the header information like Image Name, Image Type, Data Size, Load Address, Entry Point into the linux.bin.gz.
Building uncompressed Linux image

Use following commands to build uncompressed Linux image

(WORK_DIR)/u-boot_1.1.3tools/mkimage -A blackfin -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x1000 -e 0x1000 
-n "Bfin uClinux kernel" -d linux.bin uImage

 	0×1000 is used because we have compiled the kernel with that location as the entry point. If anyone wants to chose a different address for entry point (for eg, 0×20000), then please give that address instead of 0×1000. Ensure to change the entry point of the kernel.
Programming Flash

STAMP> tftp 0x1000000 uImage
STAMP> protect off all 
STAMP> erase 0x20100000 0x203FFFFF
STAMP> cp.b 0x1000000 0x20100000 $(filesize) 
STAMP> setenv bootcmd bootm 0x20100000 
STAMP> save
STAMP> reset

Build Customized uClinux
Customize Kernel

1. make menuconfig in uClinux for Blackfin project

2. select option “Kernel/Library/Defaults Selection” → “Customize Kernel Settings” and exit

3. In kernel configuration, processor and board specific options can be changed in “Processor type and features”, such as cache status, CPU, DMA, etc.

4. Driver specific options are in respective menus. Such as Ethernet driver in “Networking supporting”, sound card driver in “Sound”, video driver in “Graphic Support”, etc.

5. Save and exit. Then make the image again as mentioned before. The changes of the kernel take effects after you load and run the new image.
Customize Application and Lib

1. make menuconfig in uClinux for Blackfin project

2. select blackfin architecture in menu “Vendor/Product Selection”→“AnalogDevice Product”

3. select option “Kernel/Library/Defaults Selection” → “Customize Vender/User Settings” and exit

4. In user configuration, applications can be selected to build and debugging information can be enabled.

5. In order to configure uClibc, you should go into the folder “uClibc” and do menuconfig.

6. After the menuconfig is done, make the image again as mentioned before. The new selected application can be found in the romfs after you load and run the new image.
Customize for debugging

1. To debug an application, please refer to the document “gdb_guide_bfin.txt” in patch folder bfin_patch/kgdb_patch.

2. To do source level kernel debugging by kgdb, please refer to the README file in patch folder bfin_patch/kgdb_patch. After apply the kgdb patch file to the kernel, a simple guide “kgdb_bfin.txt” can be found in subfolder “linux-2.6.x/Documentation/blackfin/”
Reporting Bugs

1. Go to the following blackfin uclinux bug tracker page,
